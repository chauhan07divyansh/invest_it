Apollo Hospitals,"Apollo Hospitals shares surge 4% as board clears plan to list pharmacy, digital health business",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/apollo-hospitals-shares-in-focus-as-board-clears-plan-to-list-pharmacy-digital-health-business-13209471.html,"Shares of Apollo Hospitals Enterprises rallied as much as 4 percent to Rs 7,555 in today's session on July 1 after the company announced that its board approved the separate listing of its omni-channel pharmacy and digital health businesses within 18–21 months, as part of a broader reorganisation to unlock value. The board of Apollo Hospitals and its subsidiary Apollo HealthCo has granted in-principle approval for a composite scheme of arrangement aimed at reshaping its pharmacy and digital health business. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates Under the proposed scheme, Apollo will demerge its omni-channel pharmacy and digital health operations — including its telehealth vertical and investment in Apollo HealthCo Ltd (AHL) — into a new entity (NewCo). This will be followed by the merger of AHL into NewCo. Additionally, Keimed Pvt Ltd, one of India’s largest pharmaceutical wholesalers, will also be integrated into the new entity, creating a large-scale, end-to-end pharmacy distribution and digital healthcare platform. The new entity aims to clock Rs 25,000 crore in revenue by FY27. Apollo said NewCo will be classified as an Indian Owned and Controlled Company (IOCC) and is expected to be listed on Indian stock exchanges within 18–21 months, subject to regulatory approvals. As part of the plan, NewCo will acquire the remaining 74.5 percent stake in Apollo Medicals Pvt Ltd (AMPL), which owns 100 percent of Apollo Pharmacies Ltd (APL), consolidating control of its front-end pharmacy business. Post-restructuring, Apollo Hospitals Enterprise Ltd (AHEL) will retain a 15 percent stake in NewCo to ensure integration across the patient journey and healthcare continuum. Commenting on the development, Apollo Hospitals Group Chairman Dr. Prathap C. Reddy said the new structure will enable high-quality healthcare access to millions of Indians through a unique omni-channel model. Managing Director Suneeta Reddy highlighted that shareholders would benefit through direct ownership in what will become India’s largest pharmacy and digital health platform. Shobana Kamineni, Executive Chairperson of Apollo HealthCo, said the integration would create a customer-focused healthcare leader, delivering medicines through over 7,000 physical stores and an online platform covering 19,000 pincodes. Should you buy, sell or hold the stock? Morgan Stanley has maintained an overweight rating with a target price of Rs 8,058 per share, an upside potential of over 11 percent. The brokerage notes that Apollo currently trades at a discount to key peers due to its 24/7 business. Under the proposed structure, Apollo shareholders will receive 195.2 shares of NewCo for every 100 shares held in Apollo Hospitals. The international brokerage believes that if NewCo meets its aggressive revenue and EBITDA targets, it could unlock significant shareholder value. Citi has reiterated its buy call on Apollo Hospitals with a target price of Rs 8,260 per share. The firm views the plan to list the combined digital entity as a positive development. Like Morgan Stanley, the brokerage highlights that Apollo’s hospital business currently trades at a 25–30 percent discount compared to peers, primarily due to ongoing losses in the 24/7 segment and a complex corporate structure. With the spin-off and a more streamlined structure, Citi anticipates that the valuation gap will narrow. At about 9:20 am, shares of the company were trading at Rs 7,492, higher by 3 percent from the last close on the NSE. Apollo Hospitals Enterprises' stock price has gained 10 percent in the last three months.

Furthermore, the brokerage expects a 23 percent CAGR in PAT over FY25-27.

Revenue also grew 14 percent on year to Rs 5,527 crore, largely aligned with expectations of Rs 5,575 crore.

Apollo Hospitals,"Apollo Hospitals jumps 3.5% after KIE's upgrade to 'buy,' forecasting 20% upside",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/apollo-hospitals-jumps-3-5-after-kie-s-upgrade-to-buy-forecasting-20-upside-12915727.html,"Shares of Apollo Hospitals Enterprise jumped 3.5 percent on January 21 after Kotak Institutional Equities upgraded its rating from 'add' to 'buy.' The upgrade was driven by expectations of fewer execution risks, as Apollo’s greenfield bed expansion, though accounting for 70 percent of its total bed growth, is still significantly lower than that of most peers. At 12.47 pm, shares of Apollo Hospitals were trading at Rs 6,981.05 on the NSE. Kotak highlighted Apollo’s 17 percent bed expansion plan for FY25-27, noting that it is lower in percentage terms compared to most peers, which helps reduce earnings risk amid the sector's aggressive expansion spree. The brokerage also emphasised Apollo’s stronger competitive position, supported by its diversified presence and limited exposure to the three potentially hypercompetitive micro-markets of Delhi NCR. Follow our market blog to catch all the live action Kotak marginally raised its price target for Apollo Hospitals to Rs 8,270, naming it as the preferred pick within the hospital sector. While the firm expressed less confidence in Apollo’s 24/7 business, it acknowledged the vertical's strong free cash flow as a mitigating factor. Additionally, Kotak anticipates robust growth in Apollo’s offline pharmacy segment, driven by improving margins and a more measured expansion strategy. However, the ongoing reset in Apollo 24/7’s operating model—marked by reduced digital marketing spends and changes in GMV calculation—may lead to subdued GMV growth in Q3 FY25. Despite this short-term challenge, the brokerage remains optimistic, projecting a rebound in Apollo 24/7’s GMV starting Q1 FY26, driven by pharmacy sales, corporate tie-ups, digital app monetization, and an insurance module ramp-up.

Dabur India,Dabur to report high single digit growth in India business in Q1,https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/dabur-to-report-high-single-digit-growth-in-india-business-in-q1-11688655987244.html,"New Delhi: Packaged consumer goods company Dabur India said demand trends in both urban and rural India reported signs of improvement in the June quarter as inflation ebbed. “During the quarter, trends in both urban and rural India have shown signs of improvement. One of the key contributing factors to this positive development has been the reduction in inflation. Sequential moderation in inflation has positively impacted consumer spending power and is resulting in gradual improvement in offtakes in the industry. Dabur’s consolidated business including recently acquired Badshah Masala, is expected to register growth exceeding 10%,” the company said in its June quarter updated filed to the exchanges on Thursday. The update provides an overall summary of the performance and demand trends witnessed during the quarter ended June 30, 2023; the company is yet to file its quarterly earnings. Meanwhile Dabur’s international business is expected to report a strong performance with double-digit growth in constant currency, the hair oil maker said. “Softening of inflation in international markets is having a positive impact on the business. The healthcare and home and personal care (HPC) businesses in India have performed well and are projected to achieve double-digit growth backed by mid-single digit volume growth. Within HPC, the home care category is expected to report value growth in high teens and oral and hair care categories growing in low double digits. However, the F&B business, and in particular, the summer centric beverages portfolio, had a muted quarter due to unseasonal rains and a moderate summer,” it added. Consequently, India business is expected to post growth in high single digit. Moderating inflation is expected to lead to year-on-year gross margin expansion, the company said. “We are channelizing a major part of the gross margin expansion towards ramping up advertising and promotion (A&P) spends to ensure long-term success. Consequently, operating profit should grow in line with revenue growth. However, PAT growth will be lower than operating profit growth mainly due to brand amortization expenditure on account of acquisition. For the full year, we expect improvement in gross margins to continue,” the company added. Dabur’s update follows those reported by competitors such as Marico and Godrej Consumer Products Ltd., earlier this week. Godrej Consumer Products Limited is expected to report double-digit volume growth in its India business in the June quarter, the company said in its quarterly update on Wednesday.

Dabur India,"Virus scare leads to rush for Dabur’s health products, lifting Q2 results",https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/dabur-s-record-valuations-get-support-from-a-strong-set-of-q2-result-11604398599442.html,"FMCG major Dabur India Ltd surprised the Street with a record double-digit volume growth in the September quarter. Dabur’s domestic business grew 16.8% year-on-year (y-o-y), much higher than the anticipated mid-single-digit growth. The health scare caused by the pandemic led to robust growth in its healthcare business. Contribution of its healthcare portfolio to overall sales increased from 31.8% in Q2FY20 to 39.6% in Q2FY21. The healthcare segment’s revenues rose around 50% y-o-y. Within the healthcare segment, sales of Dabur Chyawanprash grew more than two times, the management said. Dabur’s market share in this category, too, grew by 190 basis points. One basis point is one hundredth of a percentage point. Dabur Honey also saw double-digit sales growth in the quarter. The management told analysts that its market penetration for both products improved compared to last year. However, analysts are wary of high growth sustaining in this segment after the pandemic-related tailwinds subside. Among other segments, home and personal care reported 9.1% growth in revenues. While this pales in comparison to the healthcare business, the growth is decent. International business revenues grew 5.5% y-o-y in Q2. The management attributed muted performance of international business to Middle Eastern and Sub-Sahara regions. Overall macro environment in the Middle East was impacted by weak oil price, it added, but expects business to recover from the current quarter. The company aims to maintain consolidated operating margins at the current 22%. Given the slew of new launches, the management expects advertisement spends to increase. Even though advertisement spends increased by around 40% in the quarter, Dabur’s ad spend-to-revenue ratio at 8% is still lower than 12% of larger peers. So, there is catching up to do to promote new products, it said. As far as cost inflation is concerned, the management said over 50% of raw material is agriculture-related. So, it is contemplating price hikes in select portfolios. Net-net, Dabur posted impressive performance on key earnings parameters. Consolidated revenue grew 13.7% y-o-y to ₹2,516 crore. Consolidated net profit was up 19.5% y-o-y to ₹481.7 crore. Following the earnings announcement, the stock rose more than 3% intraday on the NSE on Tuesday. It ended the day’s session in the green at ₹517.80. The stock is trading at a one-year forward price-to-earnings multiple of around 48 times. Peers Marico Ltd and Godrej Consumer Products Ltd are trading at multiples of around 37 times and 36 times, respectively. Dabur’s valuation looks comparatively pricey, but its robust earnings performance should provide comfort to investors.

Maruti Suzuki shares climbed to the day's high of ₹12,241 apiece on NSE. India's largest automaker commissioned a 20MWp solar power project at its new facility in Kharkhoda, Haryana, and added another 10MWp solar capacity to its Manesar facility. With these additions, MSIL's total solar capacity across its locations has increased from 49MWp to 79MWp in the last one year. “Aligned with our parent company, Suzuki Motor Corporation's Environment Vision 2050i and the Government of India's focus on renewable energy, we are systematically enhancing the use of renewable energy in our operations. By FY2030-31, Maruti Suzuki plans to reach 319MWp of solar capacity, backed by an investment of over INR 925 crore,"" said Hisashi Takeuchi, Managing Director & CEO, Maruti Suzuki India Limited. Besides, the auto giant is increasing the share of green power sourced from the State Electricity Boards for its consumption. These initiatives in solar power and green power will help the company meaningfully shift its dependence towards renewable energy. “As we scale up production to four million units, we are committed to matching that growth with equally ambitious sustainable energy practices. This solar power expansion is a crucial step towards creating a cleaner, more sustainable energy ecosystem and contributes positively to the environment. Through sustained efforts, the share of renewable source of energy in total electricity consumption is expected to reach nearly 85% by FY2030-31,” Takeuchi said. The company is progressively adopting eco-friendly manufacturing methods across all its plants. By significantly expanding its solar energy capacity, it has reinforced its dedication to sustainability and responsible environmental practices.

Maruti Suzuki,Maruti Suzuki India shares dip on delay in new variant e-Vitara launch,https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/maruti-suzuki-india-shares-dip-on-delay-in-new-variant-e-vitara-launch-11749619511668.html,"Maruti Suzuki India share price dropped more than 1% during Wednesday's trading session, as the company has reduced its short-term production goals for its first electric vehicle, the e-Vitara, by two-thirds due to shortages of rare earth materials, according to a report. This situation reflects the ongoing disruptions faced by the automotive industry as a result of China's export restrictions. India's leading automobile manufacturer, which reported on Monday that it hadn't experienced any effects from the supply crisis thus far, is now aiming to produce approximately 8,200 e-Vitaras from April to September, compared to its initial target of 26,500, as per a company document reviewed by Reuters. The company pointed to ""supply constraints"" in rare earth materials essential for the production of magnets and other components across various high-tech sectors. Maruti remains committed to achieving its output goal of 67,000 electric vehicles for the fiscal year ending March 2026 by increasing production in the coming months, the document indicated. Maruti informed reporters last week that the issue concerning rare earths had no significant effect on the launch schedule of the e-Vitara. Chair RC Bhargava mentioned that there was ""no impact at the moment"" on production, according to local media reports on Monday. As reported by Reuters, Maruti and Suzuki did not reply to inquiries for comments on Tuesday. Maruti has yet to start accepting bookings for the e-Vitara, with some analysts cautioning that the company is already behind in launching EVs in the world's third-largest car market, where Tesla is also anticipated to commence sales this year. In its earlier plan ""A,"" Maruti aimed to manufacture 26,512 e-Vitaras between April and September - the first half of the fiscal year. Under the revised plan ""B,"" it now intends to produce 8,221, as indicated in the document, reflecting a reduction of two-thirds in its production schedule. As reported by Reuters, Maruti intends to increase e-Vitara production in the second half of the financial year - from October to March 2026 - to 58,728 units, translating to roughly 440 per day at its peak, compared to an earlier target of 40,437 for those six months under plan A. Two sources from the supply chain verified Maruti's plans to reduce e-Vitara production due to shortages of rare earth magnets but did not have access to the specific figures. Maruti Suzuki India share price today opened at an intraday low of ₹12,397.85 apiece, the stock touched an intraday high of ₹12,555. According to Rajesh Bhosale, Equity Technical and Derivative Analyst at Angel One, this rate sensitive stock had a strong run last week in line with positive development on the monetary policy, however, last two sessions have been subdued. “For now we see a range for the stock where ₹12,200 is a strong support on the flip side once ₹12,700 is taken out, one can expect positive momentum to continue,” said Bhosale.

Maruti Suzuki,"Maruti Suzuki share price rallies 4% to 9-week high after April sales rise 7%
",https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/maruti-suzuki-share-price-rallies-4-to-9-week-high-after-april-sales-rise-7-11746163154150.html,"Maruti Suzuki share price in focus today: Shares of Maruti Suzuki India, the country’s largest automaker, surged 4% in intraday trade on Friday, May 2, touching a 9-week high of ₹12,727 apiece, as investors reacted positively to the company’s April sales numbers released on Thursday. The company reported a 7% increase in total sales to 179,791 units in April, compared to 168,089 units during the same month last year. Domestic passenger vehicle sales rose marginally to 138,704 units from 137,952 units a year ago. However, sales in the mini car segment, which includes the Alto and S-Presso, declined sharply to 6,332 units from 11,519 units in April last year. In contrast, sales of compact cars such as the Baleno, Celerio, Dzire, Ignis, Swift, and WagonR rose to 61,591 units from 56,953 units. Sales of utility vehicles, including the Brezza, Ertiga, Grand Vitara, and XL6, also increased to 59,022 units from 56,553 units. The Eeco van recorded sales of 11,438 units in April, compared to 12,060 units a year earlier, while light commercial vehicle Super Carry sales rose to 3,349 units from 2,496 units. The company also reported that its exports stood at 27,911 units in April, up from 22,160 units in the same month last year. Additionally, Maruti Suzuki released its production figures for the month. Total production in April rose to 179,956 units from 169,751 units a year earlier. Within the passenger vehicle segment, production of mini cars like the Alto and S-Presso fell nearly 29% to 9,714 units from 13,702 units. On the other hand, utility vehicle production — including models like the Brezza, Ertiga, and Fronx — rose by 19% to 72,640 units, reflecting strong demand. However, the company is witnessing a significant decline in demand for entry-level cars. Maruti Suzuki Chairman R.C. Bhargava noted that affordability is a major concern for small car buyers. “Unless something changes, the domestic market will remain muted. In this current year, sales of small cars have declined by about 9%. If there is such a decline in the sales of cars that can be afforded by 88% of people earning, how can we expect growth?” he said. “To boost demand, small cars have to become more affordable,” Bhargava added. “It is not the case that India has become affluent and everyone wants to buy more expensive cars.” The company reported a consolidated net profit of ₹3,911 crore for the January–March 2025 quarter, 1% lower than ₹3,952 crore in the same period last year. Revenue from operations rose 6.6% year-on-year to ₹40,920.1 crore, compared to ₹38,471.2 crore a year ago. Following the Q4FY25 results, the company’s stock target price was revised downward to ₹12,886 from ₹13,290 by Japanese brokerage firm Nomura, while retaining its ‘Neutral.’ rating on the stock. Axis Securities also reduced its target price to ₹11,170 from ₹12,065 but maintained its ‘Buy’ rating.

Maruti Suzuki,"Maruti Suzuki share price edges higher ahead of Q4 results 2025. Buy, sell or hold?

The Indian auto major has set a board meeting date to consider and approve the standalone unaudited Q4 results 2025 on 25 April 2025. Maruti Suzuki share price today opened upside at ₹11,902 apiece on the NSE and touched an intraday high of ₹12,046 per share, recording nearly one per cent rise against Thursday's close of ₹1,894 per share. The Indian auto major has informed the Indian stock market exchanges that the company's board of directors would also discuss the company's proposal for a dividend on equity shares, while debating the unaudited standalone financial results for the January to March 2025 quarter. According to stock market experts, good volume growth driven by higher average selling prices will enable the four-wheeler company to announce a good set of Q4FY25 numbers. However, they are expecting a contraction in YoY EBITDA margins due to higher sales and advertising expenses. Speaking on the market estimates regarding Maruti Suzuki Q4 results today, Seema Srivastava, Senior Research Analyst at SMC Global Securities, said, “Maruti Suzuki India Limited, India’s leading four-wheeler manufacturer, is likely to announce good set of numbers supported by good volume growth driven by higher average selling prices (ASP), and a favorable product mix. However, net profit is expected to dip slightly, reflecting pressures on margins. EBITDA margins will likely contract too YoY primarily due to increased marketing and advertising expenses, deeper discounts, and elevated depreciation and overhead costs from the Kharkhoda plant.” Seema Srivasta, also a certified Chartered Accountant (CA), said that these pressures are partially offset by operating leverage and higher sales of CNG vehicles, which typically offer better margins. The ASP increase is tempered by an unfavourable product mix, with a higher proportion of lower-priced entry-level cars and reduced export contributions. On key things to watch out for in the Maruti Suzuki Q4 results 2025 today, Seema Srivastava of SMC Global Securities said, “Key areas for investors to monitor include updates on Maruti Suzuki’s orderbook, inventory levels, and the anticipated e-Vitara launch, insights into FY26 demand trends, particularly in rural versus urban markets. Additionally, commentary on cost-control strategies, discounting trends, commodity price outlooks, and average price hikes would likely to shape investor sentiment. The company’s stance on hybrid vehicles and related policy developments also warrants attention.” Speaking on the outlook of Maruti Suzuki share price, Mahesh M Ojha, AVP — Research at Hensex Securities, said, “Maruti Suzuki share price has crucial support place at ₹11,600 apiece. On breaking below this support, the auto stock may go down to ₹11,200 per share levels. On the upper side, Maruti Suzuki share price faces hurdle at ₹11,940. On breaking above this resistance on a closing basis, we can expect Maruti Suzuki share price to touch ₹12,400 soon.” Disclaimer: The views and recommendations provided in this analysis are those of individual analysts or broking companies, not Mint.

With a target price of Rs 14,000, analysts at the firm forecast an upside potential of 10.4 percent from the last closing price of Rs 12,671 on the National Stock Exchange. Before this two-day rally, Maruti Suzuki stock had fallen for seven consecutive sessions. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates HSBC says that India’s potential as an export hub for EVs is massive and Maruti Suzuki could be one of the biggest beneficiaries. The brokerage sees monthly EV exports of 5,000–6,000 units as a plausible estimate for Maruti Suzuki's maiden E-Vitara. While percentage margins on exports could be lower, absolute margins are expected to hold steady. HSBC believes that traction in EV exports will be a key driver for the Maruti Suzuki stock. Suzuki Motor Corporation, which holds a 58 percent stake in Maruti Suzuki India, is betting big on India as a global production hub for its latest electric model. The company plans to export the model to over 100 countries, including Japan and Europe, reinforcing India’s role as a key player in EV manufacturing.

Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates Should you buy, sell or hold the Ashok Leyland stock? Nomura has a Buy call on Ashok Leyland with a target price of Rs 275 per share, reflecting an upside potential of 14.5 percent from the last close of Rs 240 on the NSE. The brokerage noted that Q4 EBITDA was in line with expectations and believes a pick-up in replacement demand could support growth in FY26. It expects 5 percent growth in the medium and heavy commercial vehicle (M&HCV) segment in FY26 and FY27, aided by improved government capital expenditure. Nomura also sees tailwinds from lower interest rates and fuel prices. It forecasts a 15 percent earnings CAGR for FY25–27, and finds current valuations attractive. Morgan Stanley has maintained an Overweight rating with a target price of Rs 284. While revenue came in below estimates, EBITDA exceeded expectations, with margins at 15 percent versus the estimated 14.3 percent. Adjusted profit after tax (PAT), accounting for a write-off of intangible assets and impairment losses, stood at Rs 1,260 crore. On the other hand, HSBC has downgraded Ashok Leyland to Hold, though it raised the target price to Rs 260, an upside of 8 percent from the previous close. The brokerage attributed the strong Q4 operating margins to operating leverage and cost-cutting efforts. However, it flagged concerns that demand and cost-related headwinds could put pressure on margins going forward. The company said it achieved the highest-ever quarterly and annual revenues, EBITDA, and PAT. The overall commercial vehicle volumes were 1,95,093 units in FY25.

Bharat Forge,Bharat Forge shares slump 4 percent fearing demand hit as US EPA rolls back green norms,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/bharat-forge-shares-slump-4-percent-fearing-demand-hit-as-us-epa-announces-rolls-back-regulations-12963798.html,"Shares of Bharat Forge tumbled 4 percent on March 13 in anticipation of a potential business impact, after the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said it will roll back a series of Biden era regulations aimed at reducing pollution and address climate concerns. The move is seen as a step away from policies for electric mobility, and the shares of the company were trading sharply lower during the trading session. US EPA administrator Lee Zeldin on March 12 said he will roll back 31 environmental rules, including norms on pollution from coal-fired power plants, climate change and electric vehicles. He called this the ‘most consequential day of deregulation in American history’, and said the roll back will remove several ‘hidden taxes’ and regulatory costs, lowering the cost of living for American families. ""Our actions will also reignite American manufacturing, spreading economic benefits to communities,"" news reports quoted him saying. ""Zeldin announced the agency will reconsider the Model Year 2027 and Later Light-Duty and Medium-Duty Vehicles regulation and Greenhouse Gas Emissions Standards for Heavy-Duty Vehicles. In addition to imposing over $700 billion in regulatory and compliance costs, these rules provided the foundation for the Biden-Harris electric vehicle mandate that takes away Americans’ ability to choose a safe and affordable car for their family and increases the cost of living on all products that trucks deliver,"" US EPA said. Recently at a conference, Bharat Forge had mentioned that before the EPA regulation take effect in 2027, there could be a surge in the pre-buy demand for its Class 8 trucks in 2026. However, if EPA does not implement the rule in 2027, the expected surge in the early demand for Class 8 trucks may not happen, Bharat Forge added. Sales of US-based Class 8 trucks reportedly contribute to 15 percent of Bharat Forge's standalone revenue. ""The American auto industry has been hamstrung by the crushing regulatory regime of the last administration. As we reconsider nearly one trillion dollars of regulatory costs, we will abide by the rule of law to protect consumer choice and the environment,"" EPA Administrator Zeldin said. The proposals are will now go through a lengthy process of approvals in order to be implemented. Discover the latest Business News, Budget 2025 News, Sensex, and Nifty updates.

Bharat Forge,"Bharat Forge shares surge 4% on mixed Q4 results, escalation of India-Pakistan tensions",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/bharat-forge-shares-surge-4-on-mixed-q4-results-escalation-of-india-pakistan-tensions-13018877.html,"Bharat Forge shares rose by over 4.5 percent to Rs 1,175 per share on May 9, as tensions between India and Pakistan escalated. The company’s Chairman and Managing Director also told CNBC-TV18 that the government has called defence equipment manufacturers to Delhi for discussions. Besides Bharat Forge, other defence-related stocks such as Hindustan Aeronautics, Bharat Dynamics, and Bharat Electronics also gained between 4 to 5 percent after India shot down several Pakistani drones and missile systems on May 8. In its Q4 update, Bharat Forge reported standalone revenue of Rs 2,160 crore, reflecting a 7 percent decline year-on-year. However, EBITDA margin came in higher than expected at 29.1 percent, supported by lower raw material and employee costs. Margin performance across subsidiaries was mixed. The overseas subsidiary showed improvement, with margins increasing to 1.2 percent from 0.3 percent in Q3. In contrast, the India subsidiary saw a decline in margins to 6.1 percent, down from 9.8 percent in Q3. The company has not provided any export guidance due to lack of visibility but said it would focus on improving profitability. Japanese brokerage firm Nomura noted that increased interest in defence following the Pahalgam attack could potentially boost revenues. The firm pointed out that the delivery timeline for the ATAGs guns order has been shortened from three years to two. It also stated that the integration of the AAM from June could lead to an estimated 2 to 3 percent upside. As a result, Nomura maintained a ‘Neutral’ rating with a target price of Rs 1,237. Meanwhile, Nuvama assigned a ‘Hold’ rating to the stock with a target price of Rs 1,230. While the defence order book is strong, Nuvama cautioned that core segments like commercial vehicles and global construction equipment and tractors are expected to show weak performance, which could limit standalone revenue and EBITDA growth.

The stock has been on a steep decline over the past six months, shedding more than 30 percent, significantly underperforming the benchmark Nifty 50 index, which has dropped by 4 percent in the same period. Catch all the market action on our LIVE blog Bharat Forge reported 16.4 percent year-on-year (YoY) drop in net profit to Rs 212 crore in Q3FY25 while revenue from operations fell 7.4 percent YoY to Rs 2,095 crore. At the operating level, EBITDA declined 8 percent YoY to Rs 609 crore and EBITDA margin contracted by 20 basis points (bps) YoY to 29.1 percent. The board declared an interim dividend of Rs 2.50 per equity share of face value of Rs 2 each. The interim dividend will be paid on or before, March 12, with February 18 fixed as the record date. Management attributed the weak performance to sluggish economic conditions in the EU, which weighed on European operations and exports to the region. Additionally, the inherent volatility in the defence business impacted quarterly numbers. On the bright side, Bharat Forge Group secured new orders worth Rs 830 crore across various business verticals in Q3FY25. The company’s defence segment generated revenue of Rs 337 crore in the quarter, while fresh order wins of ₹97 crore pushed the executable order book to Rs 5,706 crore as of December 31. BN Kalyani, Chairman & Managing Director, acknowledged the challenges, telling CNBC-TV18 that this was the first time in the company's history they had seen such a weak quarter. However, he remains optimistic about the growth potential in the defence sector, forecasting a revenue surge to Rs 2,200 crore in FY26.

Bharat Forge,"Tata Motors, Bharat Forge, other auto shares extend tariff-led selloff to crash up to 8%
",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/tata-motors-bharat-forge-other-auto-shares-extend-tariff-led-selloff-to-crash-up-to-8-12984561.html,"Shares of automakers and auto component makers strongly continued to decline on April 4, pulling the Nifty Auto index down nearly 3 percent as the 25% reciprocal tariff on imported automobiles by US President Trump continued to rattle global trade prospects. A report by Tata Mutual Fund said India exports nearly $6.8 billion worth of automobiles and auto components to US, and the tariff announcement is likely to impact the price competitiveness of ancillary companies too. Bharat Forge shares fell nearly 8 percent, owing to its significant exposure to US market, where Class 8 trucks having a strong export base. Bharat Forge Chairman & Managing Director Baba Kalyani had recently said that the US constitutes nearly 20 percent of its total exports, hence, the tariffs are expected to impact their revenue. The company has recently seen a strong decline in the Class 8 truck orders. As per data from ACT Research, cited by CNBC-TV18, Class 8 truck orders in North America have declined for a fourth consecutive month, further fuelling the sharp selloff. Tata Motors shares fell nearly 6 percent as the company is expected to see a significant hit from the tariffs, as subsidiary Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has deep exposure to the American market. JLR sold over 4 lakh units globally in FY24, of which about 23 percent were sold in US alone. ""The US alone contributed over a fifth of JLR's total revenue last year, making it a crucial market. With limited options to maintain margins and meet prior guidance, JLR will likely resort to price hikes and cost efficiencies. However, these strategies won’t yield immediate results, and a near-term hit to both revenue and profitability is expected,"" said Nirav Karkera, Head of Research at Fisdom. ""If JLR can raise prices proportionally, the revenue impact will be minimal. However, if demand falls due to higher prices, both sales volume and margins will suffer,” said Siddhartha Khemka, Head of Research and Wealth Management at Motilal Oswal in a conversation with Moneycontrol. Also Read: Will Indian carmakers, ancillary companies face a speed bump? The selloff in automotive stocks with exposure to US spilled on to domestic-oriented companies as well, with Maruti Suzuki shares dropped nearly 2 percent, while Mahindra & Mahindra shares closed with marginal losses. Nifty Auto index tumbled nearly 3 percent on April 4. Shares of auto component makers like Sona BLW Precision and Samvardhana Motherson also saw a significant decline in their share prices, falling over 6 percent and 7 percent respectively. Vaibhav Porwal, Co-Founder of investment solutions company Dezerv said, ""Export-driven sectors like Information Technology and auto components face significant challenges as they are directly exposed to tariff impacts and broader global trade friction. In this market environment, gains will likely be concentrated in select stocks rather than broadly distributed, making careful stock selection and active management strategies more effective than passive approaches."" Nikunj Saraf from Choice Wealth, said, ""The 26% US tariff on Indian exports introduces near-term economic headwinds, affecting key industries like automobiles, textiles, and gems & jewellery."" During the tariff announcement from the White House on April 2, President Trump had cited high tariff by trading partners to argue for the tariffs. ""Toyota sells one million foreign-made automobiles in the US and General Motors almost sells none. Ford sells very little. None of our companies are allowed to go into other countries,"" Donald Trump had said. ""In many cases, the friend is worse than foe in terms of trade. Such horrendous imbalances have devastated our industrial base, and put our national security at risk.,"" Trump added.

Havells India,"Havells India Q4: Cautious demand commentary sends stock 5% lower, brokerages mixed",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/havells-india-q4-cautious-demand-commentary-sends-stock-5-lower-brokerages-mixed-13001995.html,"Despite a blustering summer, cooling demand for Havells India's room air conditioners has sent the consumer durables player's shares lower in trade on April 23. Havells India posted a 16 percent year-on-year (YoY) rise profit at Rs 518 crore for the forth quarter of the previous financial year, compared to Rs 446 crore in the year-ago period. The revenue for March quarter rose 20 percent to Rs 6,543 crore, as against Rs 5,442 crore reported in the same quarter of 2024. Even though the firm reported a strong earnings beat for the quarter ended March FY2025, the cautious management commentary on lower urban demand for cooling products due to the late onset of summer, especially in South India, sparked a sell-off. The primary sales of RACs remained robust in Q4, while secondary sales slowed down in March and April, which may impact primary sales in Q1. The impact of inflationary pressures on the real estate market needs to be monitored. At 1.50 pm, shares of Havells India were lower by 3 percent on the NSE, quoting Rs 1,615.6 apiece. Follow our market blog to catch all the live updates Revenue growth was supported by strong growth in Lloyd and cable segments, even as certain categories such as switchgear and lighting witnessed muted performance. The firm's EBITDA margin stood at 11.6 percent compared to 11.7 percent on-year, driven by a balanced product mix, improved scale, and control on A&P spends. JM Financial maintained its bullish outlook on Havells shared ""based on its strong brand, distribution, in-house manufacturing, fresh investments in team + brand + distribution, opening up of export opportunity, market share gain, strong balance sheet and improved ratios."" The brokerage has a target price of Rs 1,900 per share. Kotak Institutional Equities said the secondary demand for the room air conditioner industry waned in March/April due to a mild start to summer (particularly in the South), which could weigh on primary sales in 1Q (subject to how the season pans out in the North). As a result, the brokerage kept its 'sell' rating, with a price target of Rs 1,400 apiece. Motilal Oswal noted that the management highlighted that the large appliances and cables fueled revenue growth. The ramp-up of new capacity in the C&W segment is underway. ""We believe the demand pickup in the summer season and the sustainability of Lloyd's margin will be key monitorables in the near term. Wires demand too, has been hit by the slow real estate demand. This has also hurt the margin of wires, and recovery needs to be monitored,"" said the brokerage, keeping its 'neutral' call intact, with a price target of Rs 1,710.

Havells India,Havells India shares rise despite marginal fall in Q3 net profit,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/havells-india-shares-rise-despite-marginal-fall-in-q3-net-profit-12914615.html,"Havells India Ltd shares rose on January 20 even as firm's net profit fell marginally in the December quarter. The home appliances maker's profit fell to Rs 283 crore in the three months ended December 31 from Rs 288 crore a year earlier. Havells' revenue from operations rose nearly 11% to Rs 4,883 crore, while total expenses climbed 12.3% to Rs 4,564 crore. At 1:35 pm on January 20, Havells India shares were trading 1.5% higher at Rs 1,598 apiece. The performance reflected strong demand from its switchgear project business but faced inventory de-stocking in wires during Q3. This had an impact on margins due to an inferior product mix, alongside price deflation in the lighting segment. Lloyd performed well, with losses narrowing, but the stock trades at high valuations of 58x FY26e. Havells India’s subsidiary, Lloyd, posted a strong performance with a narrowing of its losses. However, analysts have raised concerns about the stock's valuation. Currently trading at a high 58x FY26e, Havells has seen its target price revised down by Motilal Oswal Financial Services, Nomura, and Nuvama, following its earnings miss. Nomura lowered its target price to Rs 1,943 from Rs 1,990 per share but upgraded its rating on the stock to 'buy' from 'neutral'. The brokerage expects growth momentum to pick up, projecting a recovery in Havells India's growth, excluding the Lloyd segment, to 17-18 percent over FY26 and FY27. The company’s growth is expected to be driven by new capacities in cables, steady demand in wires, and a trend toward premiumisation in electric cables.

Delhivery,Delhivery shares soar over 9% as Q4 profit swings to black; full-year earnings mark strong turnaround,https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/delhivery-shares-soar-over-9-as-q4-profit-swings-to-black-full-year-earnings-mark-strong-turnaround-11747629078684.html,"Shares of Delhivery surged more than 9 percent in intra-day trade on Monday, May 19, after the company reported a turnaround in its March quarter (Q4FY25) earnings, with a positive net profit following a string of losses in previous periods. Strong operational efficiency and improving profitability across its core business segments drove the gains. The logistics major posted a consolidated net profit of ₹72.56 crore in Q4FY25, a sharp improvement from a net loss of ₹68.47 crore in the year-ago period. On a sequential basis, net profit nearly tripled from ₹24.99 crore in Q3FY25, underscoring strong cost discipline and margin expansion. Revenue from operations for the quarter stood at ₹2,191.57 crore, registering a 5.6 percent year-on-year (YoY) growth, although it fell 7.8 percent quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) from ₹2,378.30 crore. Despite the sequential dip, the profitability metrics showed significant improvement. EBITDA stood at ₹119 crore, up 160 percent YoY and 16.3 percent QoQ, with EBITDA margin rising to 5.4 percent, a 322 basis point increase YoY and 113 bps QoQ. This margin improvement is being viewed as a key indicator of the company’s strategic focus on operational leverage. For the full financial year ending March 31, 2025, Delhivery reported a consolidated net profit of ₹162.11 crore, marking a reversal from the loss of ₹249.19 crore in FY24. Annual revenue rose 10 percent to ₹8,932 crore, up from ₹8,142 crore last year. Commenting on the results, Sahil Barua, Managing Director and CEO of Delhivery, said, “We continue to deliver steady performance in our core transportation businesses. Our ongoing measures to improve profitability are visible in Q4 numbers and we expect continued momentum on this front as growth picks up in FY26.” In terms of volumes, Delhivery shipped 177 million parcels in Q4FY25, up marginally from 176 million in Q4FY24. For the full year FY25, total parcel volumes reached 752 million, rising 2 percent from 740 million in FY24. The company also recently announced plans to acquire a controlling stake in Ecom Express for ₹1,400 crore, aiming to strengthen its footprint in India’s e-commerce logistics space. Both companies have approached the Competition Commission of India (CCI) for approval. Delhivery’s stock rallied as much as 9.3 percent to hit ₹350.80, reacting to the positive earnings. The stock, however, remains 24 percent below its 52-week high of ₹461, hit in May 2024. It touched a 52-week low of ₹236.80 in March 2025. Despite the long-term underperformance — down over 26 percent in the past year — the stock has seen a strong rebound in recent months. It gained 15.5 percent so far in May, extending its rally after a 20 percent jump in April and 2 percent rise in March. The recovery followed steep declines of 22 percent in February and 7.2 percent in January.

Delhivery,"Delhivery to acquire Ecom Express for ₹1,407 crore amid layoffs and pause on IPO plans
",https://www.livemint.com/companies/delhivery-to-acquire-ecom-express-for-rs-1-407-crore-11743838287981.html,"Third-party logistics company Delhivery will acquire Ecom Express Limited for ₹1,407 crore. The company informed the exchanges on Saturday, April 5, that the Board has approved to buy nearly 99.4% of shares of Ecom Express. ""We wish to inform you that the board of directors of Delhivery Limited (""the Board"" and ""the Company"", respectively) at its meeting held today, ie, April 5, 2025, inter-alia, has considered and approved the acquisition of shares equivalent to at least 99.4% of the issued and paid up share capital, on a fully diluted basis, of Ecom Express Limited (""Ecom""/""Target Company""), for a purchase consideration not exceeding INR 1,407 Crore,"" the company said in an exchange filing. The completion of the acquisition is subject to approval from the Competition Commission of India. Following the acquisition process, Ecom Express will become a subsidiary of Delhivery. Speaking on the latest acquisition, Sahil Barua, MD and CEO, Delhivery said, “The Indian economy requires continuous improvements in cost efficiency, speed and reach of logistics. We believe this acquisition will enable us to service customers of both companies better."" In February, Mint reported that Ecom Express had laid off nearly 500 employees and paused its plans to launch an initial public offering (IPO) of its shares in an attempt to cut costs. The company’s expenses marginally rose to ₹2,921.5 crore in FY24 from ₹2,902.8 crore in FY23. Ecom Express reported a 2.2% growth in revenue to ₹2,609.2 crore in FY 24, and its losses declined to ₹255.8 crore from ₹428.1 crore in the previous year. The company had nearly 15,600 employees and associates and delivered goods to more than 27,000 pin codes, according to Ecom Express website. The report said it had put a hold on plans to go public due to volatile market conditions. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) approved the IPO in December, and it is valid until later this year. In August, filed papers to raise ₹2,600 crore through IPO, which included a fresh infusion of ₹1,284.5 crore worth of shares and an offer-for-sale.

Delhivery,Delhivery's stock slump deepens; can healthy Q2 numbers reverse the slide?,https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/delhivery-stock-slump-deepens-can-healthy-q2-numbers-reverse-the-slide-11732095345468.html,"A few stocks on Dalal Street continue to face extended sell-off pressure due to a variety of factors, including weak financial performance, rising competition, softening demand, and macroeconomic headwinds. As a result, these stocks remain sidelined, despite the overall market performing exceptionally well. One such stock in this regard is Delhivery—India's largest fully integrated logistics services provider—which has been on a downward trajectory since August 2022, with no significant pullbacks. The sell-off has intensified recently, with the stock declining 16.2% in October and an additional 3.3% this month to ₹344.25. At current levels, Delhivery’s stock is trading 51.4% lower from its all-time high of ₹708, attained in July 2022. This significant underperformance can be attributed to several factors, including a slowdown in the third-party logistics (3PL) market, increasing in-sourcing at Meesho, and the rapid growth of quick commerce within e-commerce, where logistics are typically managed in-house. Additionally, the rising market share of competitors in the 3PL space has further compounded the stock’s struggles. However, analysts expect a turnaround in the company's shares following its Q2FY25 performance, supported by new initiatives, a pickup in e-commerce demand, and expectations of a shift in Meesho’s volumes to Valmo. The company reported revenue from services at ₹2,190 crore in Q2FY25, marking a 13% YoY growth compared to ₹1,942 crore in Q2FY24. This growth was primarily driven by the PTL segment, which saw a 27% YoY increase to ₹474 crore, while express parcel, accounting for 60% of total revenue, grew steadily by 7% YoY to ₹1,298 crore, despite being a seasonally weak quarter ahead of the peak festival season. EBITDA surged to ₹57 crore in Q2FY25, reflecting a YoY improvement of ₹73 crore compared to an EBITDA loss of ₹16 crore in Q2FY24. The company also reported a profit for the second consecutive quarter, with a profit after tax (PAT) of ₹10 crore in Q2FY25, a YoY increase of ₹113 crore, compared to a loss of ₹103 crore in Q2FY24. The PTL B2B segment has grown significantly at 20% in H1FY25 compared to peers struggling for growth. The company expects growth to continue with improvement in profitability on better efficiency of automation in hubs and network centres. It envisages current service EBITDA of 3% to improve to 15-16% in the long term on operating synergies. The express segment is also likely to grow on expectations of eCommerce demand picking up, which is currently experiencing softness. The company has stabilised volume from eCommerce giants like Meesho post commencement of its in-house logistics operations, Valmo. Domestic brokerage firm Elara Securities said that the company aims to enhance its service quality and growth in both PTL and express segments through initiatives such as increasing next-day delivery by reducing return rates, foray into the air express segment by operating on prime flights from currently non-prime, undertaking rapid commerce by delivering products in 4-5 hours (already started a pilot project at Bengaluru), and expansion of current 120 freight station presence across smaller cities, aiming at large volumes from SME and individual customers with further gaining volumes from the existing express partner centre network. Following the company's Q2 numbers, domestic brokerage firm Elara Capital retained its 'buy' rating on the stock with a target price of ₹570 apiece, which indicates an upside potential of 65.6% from the stock's previous day closing price. ""Focus continues on ramping up volume and improving profitability. Overall growth momentum is likely to continue with new areas getting unlocked. We remain hopeful of an uptick in capacity utilisation,"" said the brokerage. Disclaimer: The views and recommendations given in this article are those of individual analysts.

Delhivery,Mutual funds boost holding in Delhivery to all-time high in September quarter,https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/mutual-funds-boost-holding-in-delhivery-to-all-time-high-in-september-quarter-11729076810095.html,"Mutual funds significantly increased their stake in Delhivery, a logistics and supply chain services provider, during the second quarter of the current fiscal year (Q2FY25) to an all-time high. As of the end of September 2024, 22 mutual funds collectively held a 24.91% stake in Delhivery, equivalent to 18.43 crore shares. This marks a notable increase from the 19.05% stake held at the close of the previous quarter in June, according to Trendlyne’s shareholding data. Mutual funds have been gradually accumulating shares in Delhivery over time, with the most substantial rise occurring in the recently-concluded quarter. Some of the key mutual funds that raised stakes include SBI Equity Hybrid Fund, which now holds an 8.89% stake in the company, Mirae Asset Large & Midcap Fund, which owns a 6.13% stake, and HDFC Mid-Cap Opportunities Fund, which has a 3.72% ownership. This increase comes as the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) completed the sale of its remaining shares in Delhivery during the quarter. CPPIB offloaded its 3.18% stake, or 2.34 crore shares, through multiple block deals in July, generating approximately ₹910.2 crore. Before Delhivery’s IPO in May 2022, CPPIB had been a major investor, holding about 4.38 crore shares. In April this year, CPPIB sold 2.04 crore shares for ₹908 crore. As of Q2FY25, foreign institutional investors (FIIs) remained the majority shareholders in Delhivery, holding a 55% stake. The remaining 16.4% ownership is with the general shareholders, Trendlyne data showed. Delhivery's shares have shown a notable recovery in recent months but are still trading below their IPO price of ₹487. The stock, currently at ₹408, has seen a decline of 16.22% from the issue price. Domestic brokerage firm Kotak Institutional Equities in its latest note revised the price target on the stock downwards to ₹500 apiece from the previous target of ₹560, while maintaining its 'buy' rating. The brokerage adjusted its estimates, factoring in a single-digit year-over-year growth in express parcel volumes for Q2 and Q3, considering the shift of Meesho’s volumes to Valmo during this period. The near-term impact on third-party logistics providers like Delhivery remains uncertain, particularly during the initial stages of Valmo’s entry into the logistics market. This phase might involve absorbing cash burn to either develop new business opportunities or mitigate the potential influence of third-party logistics providers on pricing over time, said the brokerage. Kotak now projects an 8% and 13% year-over-year growth in express parcel volumes for FY2025 and FY2026, respectively. This forecast also considers the impact of quick-commerce models on the e-commerce sector, as Delhivery's rapid delivery service, offering 4 to 6-hour delivery, is still in the early stages of development. The strength of its Q1 print for Express Parcel’s service margin is encouraging, said the brokerage, however, it notes the risk from peers using internal and external proceeds to bring down pricing in the near term to gain relevance in non-Meesho customer sets. In this context, the brokerage noted that the company is likely to focus on expanding gross margins by leveraging improvements in its cost structure rather than implementing price hikes. Additionally, the company aims to maintain strict control over corporate costs, providing further potential for margin enhancement.

Delhivery,Delhivery expects rapid commerce business to generate ₹80-100 crore by fiscal end,https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/delhivery-expects-rapid-commerce-business-to-generate-80-100-crore-by-fiscal-end-pat-profitable-quarter-revenue-11738938951694.html,"Listed third-party logistics player Delhivery Ltd expects its one-month-old rapid commerce business to generate revenue in the range of ₹80-100 crore by the end of the current fiscal year, underscoring the growing demand for ultra-fast deliveries in India’s e-commerce landscape, co-founder and chief executive officer Sahil Barua, said on Friday. The Gurugram-based courier company rolled out Rapid Commerce, a sub-2-hour delivery service, in January. It is specifically designed to help direct-to-consumer brands, and e-commerce platforms reduce delivery timelines and improve customer experience. “Rapid Commerce is an add-on product for the top eight cities [designed] for specific customers and SKUs [stock-keeping units]. I expect that this business will add maybe somewhere between 80 and 100 crore [rupees] of revenue to Delhivery through the financial year. And the margin structure will broadly be similar to the express business as a whole,” Barua said during the third-quarter earnings call. “It's an interesting business. It's a good capability for Delhivery to build. It helps us serve our D2C customers and their customers much better,” Barua added. The service is live in Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Chennai and is scheduled to add another 15 clients by the end of the next quarter. Competition in quick commerce is heating up, prompting players to increase investments in expanding dark stores and hiring more personnel to keep delivery timelines short. On Friday, logistics provider DTDC launched 2-4 hour express delivery with its first dark store in Bengaluru. In May, logistics aggregator Shiprocket introduced ‘Quick’ to assist small and medium-sized businesses join the quick commerce rush. Barua said that Delhivery’s first set of dark stores is already logging 500 orders daily and is expected to break even when it touches 700-800. The contribution of direct-to-consumer brands to Delhivery’s express volumes has now grown to 30%, while that of small and medium businesses has surged to 50%. The company plans to add up to 50 dark stores to service the top eight metro cities. Delhivery’s profit after tax zoomed 114% year-on-year to ₹25 crore in the December quarter, marking its third consecutive profitable quarter. Its revenue from operations grew 8% to ₹2,378 crore from the year-ago period. Express parcel revenue grew 3% YoY to ₹1,488 crore, while part truckload revenue grew 22% YoY to ₹462 crore. Former global CEO of Airtel Vani Venkatesh joined Delhivery as the chief business officer, the firm said in a statement on Friday. Venkatesh has over two decades of experience across industry verticals, having served in leadership roles in companies like Airtel, McKinsey, Unilever and Abbott Nutrition. She previously served Airtel in various management roles, including CEO for Global Business, CEO for Delhi NCR Region, chief marketing officer & CEO for their Retail Business. On Friday, the firm also appointed Namita Thapar, executive director at Emcure Pharmaceuticals Ltd, and Sameer Mehta, co-founder and CEO of boAt Lifestyle, as non-executive independent directors to the board.

The company reported a profit of ₹10.2 crore, a significant turnaround from the loss of ₹102.94 crore recorded during the same period last fiscal year. In comparison to the previous quarter, Delhivery's revenue grew by 0.8%. The results indicate a positive trend in the company's performance despite the challenges faced in the logistics sector. However, selling, general, and administrative expenses rose by 4.94% quarter-on-quarter, while they decreased by 4.74% year-on-year. This indicates a cautious approach to managing costs in an evolving market environment. The operating income saw a decline of 169.13% quarter-on-quarter but an increase of 60.39% year-on-year, signaling volatility in the company's operational efficiency. Earnings per share (EPS) for Q2 were reported at ₹0.13, representing a remarkable increase of 109.29% year-on-year, reflecting improved profitability and shareholder value. Despite the positive quarterly results, Delhivery has faced challenges in the stock market, delivering a return of -6.6% in the past week, -26.59% over the last six months, and -15.08% year-to-date. As of 15 Nov, 2024, Delhivery has a market capitalization of ₹24,527.59 crore, with a 52-week high of ₹488 and a low of ₹328.

Delhivery,Delhivery shares slip 5% to hit all-time low after Q3 earnings miss estimates,https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/delhivery-shares-slip-5-to-hit-all-time-low-after-q3-earnings-miss-estimates-11739166461622.html,"Stock market today: Extending their weakness to the third straight day on Monday, February 10, shares of Delhivery, the country's largest fully integrated logistics services provider, tumbled another 5%, slipping below the ₹300 mark for the first time since their listing in May 2022 to record a fresh all-time low of ₹299.80 apiece. Today's decline came after the company's December quarter numbers missed analysts' estimates. Despite Q3 being a seasonally strong quarter for Express Parcel due to festivities, the company failed to deliver robust growth, impacted by a consumption slowdown, the rise of quick commerce, and increased insourcing at Meesho. Moreover, analysts noted higher rental costs following the Bangalore facility going live, along with increased vehicle rental expenses due to heavy volumes in the first week of the festive season, and subdued margin expansion. Considering these challenges, domestic brokerage firm JM Financial lowered its target price for the stock to ₹380 from ₹420, while retaining its 'buy' rating. Delhivery’s shares have been on a downward trajectory, closing in the red for each of the past four months. Over this period, the stock has corrected by 30% and is down 58% from its all-time high of ₹708, attained in July 2022. This significant underperformance can be attributed to several factors, including a slowdown in the third-party logistics (3PL) market, increasing insourcing at Meesho, and the rapid expansion of quick commerce within e-commerce. In the December quarter, the company reported revenue from services of ₹2,378 crore in Q3, a growth of 8% as compared to ₹2,194 crore in the same quarter last fiscal. EBITDA reduced marginally to ₹102 crore from ₹109 crore in Q3 FY24. Profit after tax (PAT) grew 114% YoY to ₹25 crore in Q3 FY25 from ₹12 crore in Q3 FY24, making it the third consecutive profitable quarter for the company. The Express Parcel segment revenue stood at ₹1,488 crore, reflecting a sequential growth of 14.6% (2.8% YoY), driven by an 11.4% QoQ (2.5% YoY) increase in volume and a 0.3% QoQ (3.0% YoY) rise in realization. ""While volume growth was subdued due to overall consumption softness, rising quick commerce, and increased insourcing at Meesho, the almost flat realization despite the growth in 'heavy' shipments was surprising,"" said JM Financial. The brokerage channel checks suggest that Meesho’s insourcing has reached 60–65%, indicating that any further increase would be gradual. On the other hand, PTL volume declined by 3.4% QoQ (+16.6% YoY), while realizations improved by 0.9% QoQ (+4.5% YoY), leading to a sequential revenue decline of 2.5% (+21.8% YoY). The segment sustained a positive service EBITDA margin at 3.9% (compared to 2.9% in 2QFY25 and -1.8% in 3QFY24). However, the brokerage noted that the margin uptick was not as sharp as expected because the company operates an integrated network, requiring the PTL business to bear some of the costs of expanding the network for express and heavy shipments. The company has launched its rapid commerce operations in Bangalore, Hyderabad, and Chennai, with two core customers currently live and 15 more scheduled to start in 4Q. The brokerage noted that the dark store model has gained early traction, with the first store, launched about 45 days ago, now handling nearly 500 orders per day. ""The breakeven point is estimated at 700–800 orders per day, and the business is expected to reach profitability within a year. Positioned as an add-on service for the top eight cities and select SKUs, rapid commerce is seen as a valuable capability to better serve D2C brands,"" said the brokerage. According to the company's management, this business could contribute ₹0.8–1.0 billion in incremental revenue over the coming fiscal year.

Delhivery,Delhivery block deal: 1.2 crore shares worth Rs 461 crore change hands,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/delhivery-block-deal-1-2-crore-shares-worth-rs-461-crore-change-hands-13180421.html,"Delhivery Ltd shares traded flat on Thursday, June 26, after a large deal involving shares worth Rs 461 crore took place on the exchanges. Around 1.19 crore shares worth Rs 461 crore changed hands in the block deal window at Rs 388 per share. This is a minor discount to the previous session's closing price of Rs 388.15 per share. Moneycontrol could not immediately ascertain the buyers and the sellers in the deal. At 9.25 a.m., shares of the firm were quoting Rs 388.85, higher by 0.2 percent on the NSE. Follow our market blog to catch all the live updates Delhivery on June 17 announced that the CCI has approved its proposal to acquire 99.4 percent stake in rival Ecom Express for up to Rs 1,407 crore. Delhivery had earlier said that the acquisition will improve asset utilisation and boost profitability by adding to shipment volumes and eliminating overlapping costs. It also expects fewer integration challenges compared to its 2021 acquisition of SpotOn Logistics, which faced customer and volume absorption hurdles. Earlier this year, Macquarie kept an 'outperform' call on Delhivery stock, while keeping a target price of Rs 380 per share. The international brokerage said that the primary driver for the stock's recent fall is the sharp changes in third party logistics industry structure, fuelled by its key customer Meesho's internalisation push.

Delhivery,"Delhivery shares drop 3% on Jefferies downgrade, sees another 8% potential fall",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/delhivery-shares-drop-3-on-jefferies-downgrade-sees-another-8-potential-fall-13150536.html,"Shares of Delhivery dropped 3 percent to Rs 343 apiece on June 20 after global brokerage Jefferies downgraded the stock to “underperform” from “buy,” while slashing the target price to Rs 315 from Rs 500. This implies a potential downside of 8 percent from current market levels. While Delhivery’s stock has traded mostly sideways over the past six months, it has climbed nearly 40 percent from April lows. Catch all the market action on our LIVE blog Jefferies flagged a key risk from Meesho’s move to bring logistics operations in-house, which may hurt Delhivery’s third-party (3PL) express parcel business. According to Jefferies, although Delhivery shares rallied 41 percent after its acquisition of Ecom Express—driven by hopes of industry consolidation—the express parcel segment is now expected to see slower growth. The brokerage forecasted industry volumes to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 10 percent between FY25 and FY30, down from 30 percent between FY20 and FY25. It also expects marketplace share in the 3PL space to shrink to 34 percent by FY28. Meanwhile, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) approved Delhivery’s proposed acquisition of a majority stake in rival Ecom Express. The Gurugram-based logistics company, which focuses on e-commerce deliveries, reported a revenue of Rs 2,607.3 crore in FY24, compared to Rs 2,548.1 crore in FY23. Delhivery said the acquisition fits with its goal of becoming India’s most comprehensive logistics platform. The company expects that Ecom Express’ experience in high-volume and secure deliveries—especially in tier-2 and tier-3 cities—will enhance its service footprint and improve efficiency. On the financial front, Delhivery posted its first full-year net profit in FY25, reporting Rs 162 crore compared to a loss of Rs 249 crore in FY24. For the March quarter, it recorded a net profit of Rs 72.6 crore, reversing a loss of Rs 68.5 crore in the same period last year. Quarterly revenue rose 5.6 percent year-on-year to Rs 2,191.6 crore, while EBITDA almost tripled to Rs 119 crore from Rs 45.7 crore. Operating margins improved to 5.45 percent from 2.2 percent a year ago.

Delhivery,"Delhivery jumps 3% after Macquarie sees 48% upside for stock
",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/delhivery-jumps-3-after-macquarie-sees-48-upside-for-stock-12971464.html,"The shares of Delhivery rose over 3 percent on March 21 after international brokerage Macquarie issued a bullish call for the stock. The shares of the company were hovering around Rs 264 apiece in morning trade. Macquarie kept an 'Outperform' call on Delhivery stock, while keeping a target price of Rs 380 per share. The latest target price implies an upside potential of nearly 48 percent from its previous closing price of Rs 257 per share. This comes despite the recent downfall in the stock, falling nearly 40 percent from its September levels as against the 17 percent fall in the Nifty smallcap index. The international brokerage said that the primary driver for the stock's recent fall is the sharp changes in third party logistics industry structure, fuelled by its key customer Meesho's internalisation push. Notably, the e-commerce platform Meesho is reportedly working to launch an IPO in India, after reverse-flipping from US. Macquarie added that despite the poor near-term visibility for Delhivery's stock, it expects the company to accelerate its market share in this 'Winner-Takes-All' industry.

Delhivery,"Delhivery shares defy market sentiment, jump 4% on Ecom Express acquisition",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/delhivery-shares-defy-market-sentiment-jump-4-on-ecom-express-acquisition-12987481.html,"E-commerce player Delhivery shares gained four percent in a sour market, as the Street was bullish on the firm’s latest acquisition of logistics firm Ecom Express. At 3.15 pm, Delhivery’s stock was quoting Rs 267.6, higher by 3.4 percent on the NSE compared to the previous session’s closing price. Delhivery has formally announced its decision to acquire a rival firm, Ecom Express Limited, for a total sum of Rs 1,407 crore. The acquisition, undertaken as a cash deal, once completed, will make Ecom Express a subsidiary to Delhivery following regulatory approvals. Domestic brokerages JM Financials and Emkay Global reiterated their bullish ‘buy’ rating, with a target price of Rs 400 and Rs 380, respectively. “By combining forces, the companies intend to provide a more seamless and enhanced service experience to their collective customer base. Delhivery sees strategic value in Ecom’s experienced team and robust network, with the company potentially gaining the opportunity to cherry pick the right facilities,” said JM Financial. The brokerage added that after an initial period, Delhivery would take a bottom-up approach to retain the necessary Ecom Express facilities while transitioning the majority of the business to its network as substantial overlap is likely to exist. Emkay has also reiterated its ‘buy’ call. “The combined entity would command ~55-60 percent market share of the 3PL B2C express market, dwarfing the immediate peer by ~3x. Apart from scale benefits, given that both operators service ~97 percent of pin-codes in India, we believe there are significant cost synergies to be realized over the next 12-18 months.” Over the past year, shares of Delhivery have crashed 41 percent, as against a two percent fall in the frontline Nifty 50 index.

Paytm (One97),Paytm shares partially recover after tumbling 10% post FinMin's clarification on MDR speculation,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/paytm-shares-tumble-10-after-finmin-says-no-plan-to-levy-mdr-charge-on-upi-transactions-13112058.html,"Paytm shares partially recovered losses after crashing over 10 percent in the morning of June 12, after the Finance Ministry issued a clarification that no merchant discount rate (MDR) will be charged on UPI transactions. The shares of the fintech company were trading at Rs 864 apiece in the morning to emerge as the top loser on the Nifty Midcap index. They later recovered slightly to trade over 6 percent lower at Rs 899 apiece. Finance Ministry's clarification came after reports suggested that the government is planning to introduce MDR on transactions worth Rs 3,000 and above to support banks and payment solution providers. The reports had further claimed that the government may permit lenders to levy MDR on the transaction value rather than merchant turnover. Paytm shares had surged to over a three-month high of Rs 978 apiece after the reports surfaced. Finance Ministry took to X in the post market hours of June 11 to issue the clarification. ""Speculation and claims that the MDR will be charged on UPI transactions are completely false, baseless, and misleading,"" it said. ""Such baseless and sensation-creating speculations cause needless uncertainty, fear and suspicion among our citizens. The Government remains fully committed to promoting digital payments via UPI,"" it added.Speculation and claims that the MDR will be charged on UPI transactions are completely false, baseless, and misleading.Such baseless and sensation-creating speculations cause needless uncertainty, fear and suspicion among our citizens.The Government remains fully committedMinistry of Finance (@FinMinIndia) June 11, 2025 MDR is a fee which banks charge merchants for processing payments in real time. Earlier, merchants were charged an MDR fee amounting to 1 percent of the total transaction value on card payments. Later in 2020, the government waived off MDR charges to promote digital payments in the country. Earlier this year, the Payment Council of India urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government to reconsider Zero MDR policy for UPI transactions. In its letter, the industry body highlighted the pressing financial sustainability concerns facing the digital payments ecosystem due to the continued Zero MDR policy, which has been in effect since January 2020. While the government has provided financial incentives to offset some of the ecosystem's operational costs, the letter points out that the Rs 1,500 crore allocation covers only a fraction of the estimated Rs 10,000 crore annual cost required to maintain and expand UPI services. Also read: Our LIVE blog on stock market updates To address the challenge, the industry proposed the introduction of an MDR for RuPay debit cards for all merchants and a reasonable MDR of 0.3 per cent for UPI only for large merchants.

Notably, Paytm is now close to break even as its Rs 540-crore loss included a one-time cost of Rs 522 crore during the quarter under review. The Noida-based company's one-time cost was in relation to the 21 million Employee Stock Options (ESOPs) which were granted to the Managing Director and CEO Vijay Shekhar Sharma. Paytm also reported EBITDA positive with a surplus of Rs 81 crore during Q4. Its revenue from operations however tumbled 16 percent year-over-year to Rs 1,912 crore.

The latest target price implies an upside potential of nearly 22 percent from the stock’s current market price. ""Even excluding incentive, company reported 1% sequential growth, despite 4Q being a seasonally weak quarter.

Emkay Global reiterates 'Buy' rating with Rs 1,050 target price Emkay Global retained its 'Buy' rating on the stock, with a target price of Rs 1,050. The latest target price implies an upside potential of over 19 percent from the stock’s current market price. ""Though Paytm reduced overall loss in FY25 mainly due to business consolidation and cost optimization, we expect it to turn net profit-positive in FY26 on the back of revenue acceleration from payment as well as the financial services business, higher treasury income on cash balance boosted by recent stake sales, and lower depreciation/ESOP cost,"" Emkay said.

Nykaa,"Nykaa shares in focus as Q4 to see mid-twenties revenue growth, Nomura maintains 'neutral' call",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/nykaa-shares-in-focus-as-q4-to-see-mid-twenties-revenue-growth-nomura-maintains-neutral-call-12986544.html,"Shares of FSN E‐Commerce Ventures, the operator of beauty platform Nykaa, will be in focus on April 7, after the internet firm shared its business update for the quarter ended March, 2025. Nykaa witnessed a continued growth momentum in Q4, and the firm's consolidated net revenue is expected to grow in low to mid twenties on-year. ""With this, Nykaa’s full financial year FY2025 revenue growth is estimated to be at similar levels in mid‐twenties, indicating consistent growth across all quarters of FY2025,"" said the firm in an exchange filing. Follow our market blog to catch all the live updates The company’s Beauty vertical continued to outperform the broader industry, with Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) growth projected in the low thirties. Nykaa attributed this to sustained investments in customer acquisition, strong order volume growth, and robust retail performance. Another key growth lever has been the ‘House of Nykaa’ strategy, with both homegrown and acquired brands performing strongly. Net revenue growth for the Beauty business remained steady in the mid-twenties, in line with recent quarters. Nykaa’s Fashion vertical, meanwhile, saw GMV growth in the high teens, reflecting a sequential improvement in the core platform business. However, net revenue growth lagged due to a subdued performance from its owned brands and a dip in content-driven activity in Q4, which typically sees higher engagement in the festive-heavy third quarter. Japanese brokerage Nomura reiterated its neutral call on the internet player, with a target price of Rs 190 per share. The brokerage said that the beauty and personal care GMV growth was along expected lines, however, while it predicted 11.1 percent growth for the fashion segment's GMV as against the high teens growth reported. Overall, Nomura had predicted mid-20s revenue growth, at around 25 percent for the firm in Q4. Over the past year, shares of Nykaa have traded flat, falling one percent.

Nykaa,"InCred Equities initiates coverage on Nykaa with a reduce rating; cuts target price by 39%
",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/incred-equities-initiates-coverage-on-nykaa-with-a-reduce-rating-cuts-target-price-by-39-12906489.html,"InCred Equities has initiated coverage on FSN E-Commerce Ventures Ltd, the parent company of Nykaa, with a ""Reduce"" rating and a lowered target price. The outlook highlights a plateauing revenue growth trajectory coupled with shrinking EBITDA margins, pressured by rising costs of goods sold (COGS) and intensifying competition. The brokerage house has cut target price by 39 percent to Rs 103 a share from current market price. On January 9, Nykaa's shares on NSE were trading 0.39% higher at Rs 170.18 apiece. Nykaa’s revenue growth is normalising after a period of strong expansion—55% in FY22, 36% in FY23, and 24% in FY24. Future growth is projected at 26% for FY25F and 25% for FY26F-FY27F, according to InCred Equities. The deceleration is attributed to slowing growth in the beauty and personal care (BPC) segment, which accounts for 73% of GMV. Increasing cost of goods sold, driven by competition from Tira in the luxury segment and a shift toward lower-margin mass/masstige products, presents key challenges, it said. Additionally, the low-margin eB2B segment is compounding these pressures. While fulfillment costs could see some relief with the addition of new warehouses, rising marketing expenses and intensified competition are expected to further squeeze EBITDA margins, which are projected to decline to 5.1% by FY27F, it said. Nykaa’s high-margin services, including marketing support and marketplace services, have seen a sharp slowdown. Marketing services growth decelerated from 92% in FY22 to 18% in FY24, while marketplace services stagnated at 19% growth in FY24 after peaking at 188% in FY22. Together, these services contribute just 13.4% to revenue but remain vital for profitability, the brokerage said. Meanwhile, Nykaa's 27 owned brands are making progress but face hurdles. In BPC, GMV contribution rose from 11.1% in FY22 to 13.1% in FY24, though dependence on third-party brands hampers pricing power.

Avenue Supermarts (DMart),"DMart share price skids 5%, slips below ₹4,000 mark after Q4 business update",https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/dmart-share-price-skids-5-slips-below-rs-4-000-mark-after-q4-business-update-11743738799735.html,"Stock market today: Shares of Avenue Supermarts, which operates the retail chain DMart, tumbled 5% in the trading session on Friday, April 04, to slip below the ₹4,000 mark, reaching ₹3,946 apiece. This decline came following the company's March 2025 quarter (Q4FY25) business update, which fell short of analysts' expectations. In an exchange filing on Thursday, the company reported standalone revenue from operations of ₹14,462 crore for the March quarter, reflecting an increase of over 16.67% from ₹12,393 crore in the same quarter of the previous fiscal year (Q4FY24). During the quarter, the company opened 28 new stores—the highest quarterly addition in the last four years. With these new openings, the total store count has reached 415. Overall, the company has added 50 stores in FY25 (which is one of its key metrics), which is higher than 41 stores in FY24 and 40 stores in FY23. The FY25 store addition count also came in higher than analysts' estimates of 40. Earlier, in its annual investors’ day, the company had guided that the store count addition would, over the long term, sustain a 10-15% CAGR. Meanwhile, the company reported weaker-than-expected results for the December quarter, as rising Q-commerce activity continued to affect store performance in metro cities—though the impact was less severe than in Q2FY25. Earlier, in its Q3 results update report, Axis Securities stated that the company will continue to face challenges in optimising its overall store metrics in the near term due to several factors, such as increasing competition from both organized players (Reliance, Star Bazaar, Zudio) and online players (Zepto, Blinkit, Instamart), resulting in erosion of market share in metros and smaller towns. Further, it noted that higher discounts to mitigate the impact of rising competition will affect the overall profitability of the company. Additionally, discretionary demand continues to remain subdued, with a meaningful recovery anticipated only from FY26 onwards. Larger and newer stores also have longer gestation periods, thereby impacting the overall store performance, it added. The company shares have recovered 20% in March after losing 33% in 5 months. At current levels, the stock is trading 32% lower from its peak of ₹5900 apiece, which it attained in October 2021. Analysts noted that recent fundraising by the top three quick commerce players has significantly intensified competition. While they believe DMart’s value-driven model can coexist with the convenience-led model of quick commerce in the long run, heightened pricing pressure may weigh on DMart’s growth and margins in the near term.

Avenue Supermarts (DMart),DMart shares dip 5% to 3-month low as analysts remain cautious after Q2 business update,https://www.livemint.com/market/dmart-shares-dip-5-to-3-month-low-as-analysts-remain-cautious-after-q2-business-update-11728019285386.html,"Shares of Avenue Supermarts, which operates the retail chain DMart, tumbled 5% in the trading session on Friday, 4 October, to a three-month low of ₹4,703 apiece. This decline came following the company's September 2024 quarter (Q2FY25) business update, which fell short of analysts' expectations. In an exchange filing on Thursday, the company reported standalone revenue from operations of ₹14,050.32 crore for the September quarter, reflecting an increase of over 14.2% from ₹12,307.72 crore in the same quarter of the previous fiscal year (Q2FY24). The company recorded revenue of ₹10,384.66 crore in Q2 FY23 and ₹7,649.64 crore in Q2 FY22. As of September 30, 2024, the total number of stores operated by the company stood at 377. Following the company's Q2 business update, global brokerage firm Citi maintained its 'sell' rating on the stock with a target price of ₹3,350. The 14.2% year-on-year (YoY) Q2 revenue growth fell short of Citi's estimate of 19%. Further, the revenue per store showed a 2.9% CAGR over five years, reflecting only a 2.2% YoY growth compared to Citi's projection of 6.5%. The brokerage remained cautious on the stock, given its current valuation. Similarly, Goldman Sachs also continued with its 'sell' rating on the stock with a target price of ₹4,050. The brokerage notes a significant moderation in growth, which appears to be driven by a slowdown in same-store sales growth (SSSG). This slowdown is likely influenced by the rapid expansion of quick commerce players. Additionally, the brokerage highlighted that the store addition target may be at risk and has adjusted its FY25/26/27 earnings per share estimates down by 2% to reflect lower-than-expected revenue growth. Morgan Stanley maintained an 'overweight' rating on the stock with a target price of ₹5,769, highlighting that while the standalone Q2 revenue did not meet estimates, operational metrics showed improvement, albeit at a slower rate. Similarly, Macquarie also holds an 'overweight' rating on the stock, with a target price of ₹5,600 per share. In its August report, Bernstein maintained an ‘overweight’ rating on the stock with a target price of ₹6,300. It highlighted that DMart stands to benefit from rising incomes and the ongoing shift from unorganised to organised retail, positioning itself as the most efficient player in this sector. It believes that DMart possesses the key attributes to enhance consumer engagement within its touchpoints and has access to a substantial total addressable market (TAM) of $600 billion as a potential growth arena. The company in the June quarter reported a consolidated net profit of ₹773.8 crore for the first quarter of 2024-25, marking a 17.5% increase from ₹658.8 crore in the same period last year. The company's consolidated revenue from operations also saw a YoY rise of 18.6%, reaching ₹14,069.1 crore, up from ₹11,865.4 crore. The stock began its upward momentum in February 2024, increasing by 22% to date. However, it continues to trade at a 20% discount to its record peak of ₹5,900, which it reached in October 2021.

Avenue Supermarts (DMart),DMart Q2 growth underwhelms as brokerages split on Avenue Supermarts stock; analysts flag store expansion risks,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/dmart-q2-growth-underwhelms-as-brokerages-split-on-avenue-supermarts-stock-analysts-flag-store-expansion-risks-12835168.html,"Brokerages delivered a divided outlook on DMart’s stock following the supermarket chain's Q2FY25 business update on Thursday. Avenue Supermarts, the operator of DMart, reported a 14 percent year-on-year growth in standalone revenues to Rs 14,050 crore for the quarter ended September 2024. However, several analysts highlighted concerns over the pace of growth. Morgan Stanley remained 'Overweight' on Avenue Supermarts with a target price of Rs 5,769 as it noted that while standalone Q2 revenue fell short of estimates, operational metrics improved, albeit at a slower pace. The growth trend was unexpectedly weaker, prompting the brokerage to await further clarity from the management during the upcoming Q2 results on the reasons behind the slower growth. Follow our market blog to catch all the live action Macquarie continued to rate DMart as 'Outperform' and has set a target price of Rs 5,600. Although sales growth has slowed compared to Q1 levels, store additions also slightly missed expectations. Macquarie anticipates a sequential moderation in gross margins due to changes in the product mix. Goldman Sachs, meanwhile, retained a 'Sell' rating with a target price of Rs 4,050. The firm highlighted a sharp slowdown in growth, likely affected by the rise of quick commerce (Q-Commerce). Growth moderation is attributed to a slowdown in Same Store Sales Growth (SSSG), leading to a 2 percent reduction in FY26 and FY27 EPS estimates. As of September 30, the Radhakishan Damani-owned company operated a total of 377 stores across the country. The company had opened six new stores during the quarter. It aims to add 45 stores in FY25 with the medium-term band at 45-60 stores per annum. However, analysts at Goldman Sachs flagged risks in store expansions. Citi is also bearish on DMart with a 'Sell' rating and a target price of Rs 3,350 per share. The brokerage believes throughput is being negatively impacted by an unfavourable product mix and store additions, with six new stores added during the quarter. Given the risks surrounding store expansions and earnings, Citi remains cautious at the current valuation.

The company's revenue during the quarter also fell 11.4 percent to Rs 5,306.2 crore compared to the September quarter 2019 but there was 36.6 percent sequential growth. ""FMCG and staples demand remains robust. September 2020 sales of all stores exceeded September 2019 sales for FMCG and staples while general merchandise and garments did lesser sales in the same period,"" CEO & Managing Director Neville Noronha said. However, ""discretionary consumption has seen significant improvement over Q1FY21. We were at 22.7 percent revenue contribution from general merchandise and apparel business in Q2FY21 as compared to the usual 27.3 percent contribution for the year. Almost all of the shopping in Q1FY21 was need-based and essential in nature. In light of that, Q2FY21 sales contribution from general merchandise and apparel is encouraging,"" he added. Other income also supported profitability, rising significantly to Rs 52.2 crore in the September quarter from Rs 8.1 crore YoY. At the operating level, consolidated earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) dropped 36 percent to Rs 329.5 crore and margin contracted 240 bps to 6.2 percent compared to thecorresponding quarter of last fiscal. ""Overall better-than-expected performance led by a quicker normalisation of overall business with a strong sequential recovery. We expected a decline of 15/47/49 percent for revenue/EBITDA/PAT respectively,"" Himanshu Nayyar, Lead Analyst–Institutional Equities, Yes Securities told Moneycontrol. Gross margins were in line with expectations at 14 percent, given the inferior mix in the favour of FMCG and staples while EBITDA margins were impacted due to negative operating leverage, he said. The company said it continued to focus on new stores and has opened six DMart stores in the quarter. ""We have closed two of Mumbai stores for customers and converted them into fulfillment centers (FC) for our ecommerce business."" The stock gained only 5.2 percent during theSeptember quarter and 8 percent year-to-date. After the recent underperformance, the stock is currently trading at 55x FY22E P/E and 35x EV/EBITDA, Nayyar said. ""While we have been negative on the stock given the risks to FY21 earnings and medium-term risk of multiple de-rating, the better-than-expected recovery trajectory and the correction in valuation multiples makes us turn more constructive on the stock. Increased focus and increasing traction in DMart Ready is another positive sign,"" he added. Discover the latest Business News, Budget 2025 News, Sensex, and Nifty updates.

Avenue Supermarts (DMart),"D-Mart operator Avenue Supermarts surges around 4%, but Citi maintains 'Sell'; here is why",https://www.zeebiz.com/market-news/news-dmart-share-price-nse-bse-avenue-supermarts-q2-business-update-citi-says-sell-257453,"D-Mart share price Q2 business update, Avenue Supermarts share price NSE BSE: Shares of Avenue Supermarts, the entity that owns and operates the supermarket chain D-Mart, surged as much as 3.82 per cent to hit a high of Rs 3,864.90 apiece on the BSE in the early trade on Wednesday, October 4, a day after the company shared its Q2FY24 business update. The stock finally ended at Rs 3,871, up 3.99 per cent. The company said its revenue during the July-September period of the current fiscal came in at Rs 12,307.72 crore, up 18.5 per cent against Rs 10,384.66 crore registered in the corresponding quarter of the previous fiscal. The total number of stores as of September 30, 2023, stood at 336. Shares of the Radhakishan Damani-founded company, which was once a solid wealth creator, have declined more than 13 per cent over the past 12 months. In comparison, the benchmark S&P BSE Sensex has gained over 12 per cent during the window. Global brokerage Citi, in its research report, post-Q2 business update, said that there are no signs of throughput recovery yet. The brokerage believes that revenue/sq ft continues to be impacted by an inferior product mix. It further highlighted that the company added only nine stores during the quarter and that it remains cautious of the stock at its current value. However, Macquarie has maintained an 'overweight' rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 4,550. The brokerage notes that the company's Q2 store additions and sales growth are broadly in line with their estimates. Further, its four-year sales compound annual growth rate (CAGR) has risen marginally from Q1 levels. The marginal uptick in sales momentum was led by a gradual recovery in the high-margin apparel segment, the brokerage adds. The retail chain D-Mart operator Avenue Supermarts reported a 2.46 per cent rise in its consolidated net profit at Rs 658.71 crore for the April-June 2023 quarter, as lower sales of apparel and general merchandise impacted margins. The company had posted a net profit of Rs 642.89 crore in the corresponding quarter a year ago, said Avenue Supermarts in a BSE filing. Its revenue from operations was up 18.20 per cent to Rs 11,865.44 crore during the quarter under review as against Rs 10,038.07 crore in the same quarter last fiscal. Avenue Supermarts' total expenses were at Rs 11,006.92 crore, up 19.74 per cent in the first quarter of FY24. During the June quarter, D-Mart opened three new stores, taking the total count to 327 with a retail business area of 13.5 million square feet. D-Mart operates across Maharashtra, Gujarat, Daman, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, NCR, Chhattisgarh and Punjab.

Avenue Supermarts (DMart),"Avenue Supermarts Q2 underwhelms on stiff competition from online rivals; shares crack 8%
",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/avenue-supermarts-q2-underwhelms-as-competitive-intensity-lower-sssg-drags-12841205.html,"DMart parent Avenue Supermarts earnings show for the quarter ended September left brokerages disappointed, as the revenue and net profit fell below expectations. The retail major's net profit for the second quarter of the current financial year rose by 5.8 percent on-year, reaching Rs 659.6 crore, compared to Rs 623.6 crore in the same period last year. For the quarter, Avenue Supermarts revenue rose by 14.4 percent YoY to Rs 14,444.5 crore, up from Rs 12,624.4 crore year-on-year. The Street showed its disappointment in the results. At 9.20 am, DMart shares cracked eight percent to quote Rs 4,210.55 on the NSE. According to international brokerage Bernstein, the biggest miss for Avenue Supermarts was revenue growth, which was the slowest in four years. The like-for-like growth was the slowest in three years. The management noted that the stores/operations in metro cities, including the online offering DMart Ready, were impacted by online grocery format players, including quick commerce players. Additionally, employee costs were higher-than-expected as a result of DMart's continuing efforts to improve service levels and building capability for the future, noted Nuvama Institutional Equities. Average bill size, which increased during the pandemic owing to stockpiling, has remained sticky, even as DMart added more stores in new geographies. Average bills cut per store per day, which is a reflection of footfall per store per day, has also grown slightly. ""Combining the aforementioned two observations implies the average visitation has not dipped, but part of the buying has shifted to other platforms, such as quick commerce,"" said Nuvama. During FY12-20, DMart sustained a consistent SSSG (same store sales growth) above the 10 percent print. However, that has come off with older stores maturing. For Q2, the like-for-like revenue growth for the same cohort of stores was at 5.5 percent. DMart can return to seeing 20 percent growth on fast store/retail area addition, said Bernstein. If the company pivots its area of focus to 4-6 hour delivery and sees reduced competitive intensity from quick-commerce in metro cities, it could see the same growth rate again. These factors might take 3-5 quarters to impact DMart. For the quarter, DMart opened six stores, as compared to nine in the same quarter of the previous year, taking taking the total store count to 377. ""DMart has a pattern of opening more stores in the second half than in the first half. We are building in 45 stores for FY25, which seems achievable as per the commentary as well as the trailing 12 months’ running rate,"" said Nuvama Institutional Equities. Should you buy, sell or hold DMart shares? Hong Kong-based brokerage CLSA said the net profit was notably below estimates, but the firm is making an appropriate pivot to private labels, which will place it well to meet future competition. Private labels are brands which are owned and sold solely by the owner of the retail store. As a result, CLSA maintained its 'outperform' rating on DMart. Global broking firm JPMorgan slashed its target price on Avenue Supermarts, downgrading the firm to a 'neutral' rating. ""Expanding scale for quick-commerce may continue to weigh on stock performance, depsite the recent share price correction. Also, the extent of SSSG moderation surprised us,"" said the brokerage. It lowered its SSSG/revenue forecast by 4-6 percent over FY25-26. Building in the impact of online grocery players and weakness in DMart’s H1FY25 showing, we are cutting FY25E PAT by 7 percent, said Nuvama. This yields a revised target price of Rs 4,500, down from Rs 5,183 per share.

This investment is part of Nazara's strategic partnership with Khandelwal and Sacheti, aimed at accelerating the diversified gaming and sports media firm's ambition to become the global leader in gaming and digital entertainment. The deal comes on heels of Nazara Technologies closing a Rs 855-crore funding round from a slew of new and existing investors including SBI Mutual Fund in November 2024. Through this transaction, Axana Estates will acquire about 5.4 percent stake in Nazara Technologies through a preferential issue of equity shares at a price of Rs 990 per share. Apart from Khandelwal and Sacheti, Axana Estates LLP also counts Siddhartha Sacheti (Mithun Sacheti's brother) and Yash Sacheti (Siddhartha Sacheti's son) as designated partners.

This consolidation of ownership will provide growth capital and bring strategic expertise to support Nazara, its promoters & team in the journey of becoming a world-leading gaming and entertainment brand” Khandelwal said in a statement. Sacheti stated ""Gaming is the new consumer play, blending entertainment, technology, and community to create unmatched engagement. It has become a powerful platform to connect with audiences and shape consumer behaviour in real time."" ""We are thrilled to partner with Nazara to unlock its immense potential and drive global growth and look forward to unlocking the Company’s full potential in collaboration with its exceptional management team"" he said. Nazara Technologies said the investment will be used towards accelerating its organic growth, making strategic acquisitions, and expansion into new markets. Nazara Technologies, one of the country's oldest gaming firms, has been aggressively pursuing acquisitions to scale and expand its portfolio of businesses. The company operates across a range of sectors such as gaming (World Cricket Championship, Kiddopia, Animal Jam, Classic Rummy etc), e-sports (Nodwin Gaming, Sportskeeda), advertising (Datawrkz) and physical entertainment (Funky Monkeys). On January 20, Nazara Technologies announced that it is buying intellectual property (IP) rights of two mobile gaming titles - CATS: Crash Arena and King of Thieves - from Barcelona-based game developer and publisher ZeptoLab for Rs 66.6 crore ($7.7 million) in an all-cash deal. The two games reported $6.1 million in revenues in the calendar year 2024. Through this acquisition, Nazara will own the game IPs and will also publish the games under the “Nazara Publishing” banner, it said. In September, Nazara made its largest bet to date by announcing an investment of Rs 982 crore in Moonshine Technology, the parent firm of online poker platform PokerBaazi. The firm also acquired UK-based gaming studio Fusebox Games for Rs 228 crore in an all-cash deal and purchased a 15.86 percent stake in esports community platform Stan for Rs 18.4 crore in cash through a secondary transaction from existing shareholders. Nazara is also buying remaining stakes in its subsidiaries Paper Boat Apps, which owns the gamified learning app Kiddopia, and Nextwave Multimedia, a mobile-gaming studio, to take 100 percent ownership. These deals are part of the company's new operating model, implemented last year, which aims to bring the core gaming business into the parent entity. This will increase the parent firm's revenue and free cash flow, which can then be deployed for both organic and inorganic growth. In an interview to Moneycontrol in May 2024, founder Nitish Mittersain said he expects the core gaming business to become the largest revenue generator for the company over the next two or three years. Nazara Technologies is also partnering with Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) to launch an in-game monetisation platform, gCommerce, designed to help game developers boost their monetisation efforts. Slated for a Q1- FY26 rollout, the platform will enable developers to integrate e-commerce within games, thereby providing them with new revenue streams.

The preferential equity issue saw participation from investors such as SBI Mutual Fund, CaratLane co-founder Mithun Sacheti with brother Siddharth Sacheti, and Plutus Wealth associate Junomoneta Finsol. Other investors include Think Investments, Discovery Investments, Cohesion Investments, Chartered Finance and Leasing, Ratnabali Investments and Aamara Capital. “Nazara has demonstrated its ability to attract top-tier investors who believe in our long-term vision of establishing India’s first globally respected gaming powerhouse. This Rs 900 crores fundraise will be instrumental in accelerating our growth across key segments"" Nazara Technologies founder Nitish Mittersain said in a statement. Through this transaction, Nazara Technologies is proposing to issue 94.31 lakh shares (94,31,294 shares) at an issue price of Rs 954.27 per share. The company's shares were trading at Rs 940.8 on the National Stock Exchange at the day's close on September 18. This is the second fundraise for Nazara Technologies within a year, following the Rs 760 crore raised from marquee investors such as Zerodha co-founder Nikhil Kamath, ICICI Prudential MF, and SBI Mutual Fund in recent months.. The company had also raised Rs 315 crore from a clutch of institutional investors including Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC-managed investment firm Gamnat Pte and Ahmedabad-based Plutus Wealth Management in October 2021. Nazara Technologies went public in February 2021. Prior to this fundraise, Nazara had a cash balance of Rs 1,450 crore, which the country's first publicly-listed firm has been using for new acquisitions, investments, and consolidating its positions in existing subsidiaries such as Paper Boat Apps and Nextwave Multimedia. Last week, Nazara Technologies made its largest bet to date, by announcing an investment of Rs 982 crore into Moonshine Technology, the parent firm of online poker platform PokerBaazi. This includes picking up 47.7 percent stake for Rs 832 crore in a secondary transaction, of which Rs 592.26 crore will be paid by the company through cash and the balance Rs 239.25 crore will be paid through a share swap, representing a 3.17 percent stake in the company. Nazara will also pump an additional Rs 150 crore in primary capital into Moonshine Technology through compulsory convertible preference shares at a future date. This transaction will provide the company a majority stake in Moonshine Technology. Last month, Nazara Technologies also acquired UK-based gaming studio Fusebox Games for Rs 228 crore ($27.2 million) in an all-cash deal. These deals were part of Nazara's push to boost its gaming business, which Mittersain believes would be the biggest revenue generator for the company in the coming years. In March, it earmarked a $100-million war chest for global expansion over the next 24 months.

In an interview to Moneycontrol in May, founder Nitish Mittersain said he expects the core gaming business to become the largest revenue generator for the company over the next two or three years. Earlier this month, Nazara reported revenue of Rs 318.9 crore for the September quarter, a 7.3 growth from the year-ago period. Net profit, however, dipped 32.8 percent to Rs 16.2 crore.

Dilip Buildcon,Dilip Buildcon Allots 8.39 Lakh Shares on Warrant Conversion,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/dilip-buildcon-allots-8-39-lakh-shares-on-warrant-conversion-alpha-article-13137068.html,"Dilip Buildcon Limited, a prominent infrastructure company, announced on June 18, 2025, that its Warrants Committee has approved the allotment of 8,39,352 equity shares of face value Rs. 10 each. This allotment, conducted at an issue price of Rs. 328.05 per share (including a premium of Rs. 318.05 per share), follows the exercise and conversion of an equal number of convertible warrants by warrant holders. The move increases the company's paid-up share capital and provides it with additional funds.Impact on Equity Share Capital (Post Allotment)ParticularsPre-Allotment (Number of Shares)Pre-Allotment (Value in Rs.)Shares AllottedValue of Shares Allotted (Rs.)Post-Allotment (Number of Shares)Post-Allotment (Value in Rs.)Issued Capital16,16,05,4811,61,60,54,810 (Rs. 161.60 crore)8,39,35283,93,520 (Rs. 83.93 lakh)16,24,44,8331,62,44,48,330 (Rs. 162.44 crore)Subscribed and Paid-up Capital16,16,05,4811,61,60,54,810 (Rs. 161.60 crore)8,39,35283,93,520 (Rs. 83.93 lakh)16,24,44,8331,62,44,48,330 (Rs. 162.44 crore)Details of the AllotmentThe Warrants Committee of Dilip Buildcon's Board of Directors convened on June 18, 2025, and approved the allotment of 8,39,352 equity shares. These shares, each with a face value of Rs. 10, were issued at a price of Rs. 328.05 per share. This issue price includes a significant premium of Rs. 318.05 per share over the face value. The allotment was made against the receipt of the balance subscription amount of Rs. 246.03 per warrant, which constitutes 75% of the issue price. This tranche of payment aggregated to Rs. 20,65,05,772.56 (approximately Rs. 20.65 crore). The initial 25% of the issue price, amounting to Rs. 82.02 per warrant (totaling Rs. 6,88,43,651.04 or approximately Rs. 6.88 crore), had been received by the company at the time of the original warrant allotment. Therefore, the total consideration received by Dilip Buildcon for these 8,39,352 converted warrants amounts to Rs. 27,53,49,423.60 (approximately Rs. 27.53 crore). This conversion pertains to 8,39,352 convertible warrants, which, as per the company's disclosure, were the balance warrants due for conversion from a larger pool. This action is in continuation of a prior announcement dated June 13, 2025, which concerned the allotment of 1,53,90,510 equity shares through warrant conversions.Impact on Equity Share CapitalAs a direct result of this allotment, Dilip Buildcon's equity share capital has expanded. The issued, subscribed, and paid-up equity share capital of the company has increased from 16,16,05,481 equity shares to 16,24,44,833 equity shares. In terms of value (at a face value of Rs. 10 per share), the issued capital has risen from Rs. 1,61,60,54,810 (approximately Rs. 161.60 crore) to Rs. 1,62,44,48,330 (approximately Rs. 162.44 crore). The subscribed and paid-up capital figures have seen an identical increase.Allottees and Issuance TypeThe 8,39,352 newly allotted equity shares were issued on a preferential allotment basis through private placement to two institutional investors. The details of the allottees are as follows:Quanterra Stratergies LLP: Allotted 1,89,508 equity shares.Spectrum Edge LLP: Allotted 6,49,844 equity shares.This type of issuance allows companies to raise capital from a select group of investors, often more quickly than through a public offering.Regulatory Framework and Shareholder RightsDilip Buildcon has confirmed that this allotment and conversion process has been carried out in strict compliance with the provisions of the SEBI (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2018 (commonly known as ICDR Regulations), as well as the terms and conditions stipulated at the time of the warrant allotment. The company also referred to the SEBI Disclosure Circular (SEBI/HO/CFD/PoD2/CIR/P/0155 dated November 11, 2024) in its regulatory filings. Crucially for all shareholders, the newly allotted equity shares will rank pari passu with the existing equity shares of the company in all respects. This means that the new shareholders will have the same rights as existing ones, including rights related to the payment of dividends and voting rights at shareholder meetings.Procedural AspectsThe decision to allot these shares was taken at a meeting of the Warrants Committee of the Board of Directors, which was held on June 18, 2025. The meeting commenced at 10:00 AM and concluded at 10:30 AM on the same day. In adherence to corporate governance norms and SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 2015 (as amended), Dilip Buildcon has also announced the closure of its trading window. This restriction applies to all insiders, designated persons, their immediate relatives, connected persons, fiduciaries, and intermediaries. The trading window will remain closed for 48 hours from the time this information is made generally available to the public, to prevent any potential misuse of unpublished price-sensitive information.Context of Warrant ConversionConvertible warrants are financial instruments that give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to purchase a company's equity shares at a predetermined price (the exercise price) within a specified timeframe. Companies often issue warrants as part of a fundraising strategy, sometimes attached to other securities like bonds or offered to existing shareholders. For investors, warrants offer the potential to profit if the company's stock price rises above the exercise price. For the company, warrant conversions lead to an infusion of equity capital, strengthening the balance sheet without immediate large-scale dilution that might occur with a direct equity offering. The staggered nature of capital inflow (initial payment for warrants, then balance on conversion) can also align with the company's funding needs over time.Market ConsiderationsThe allotment of new equity shares, such as this conversion by Dilip Buildcon, increases the total number of outstanding shares. This can lead to a dilution of Earnings Per Share (EPS) in the immediate term, as the company's net profit is now divided among a larger number of shares. However, the impact on long-term shareholder value depends on how effectively the company utilizes the capital raised. If the funds contribute to profitable growth projects, debt reduction leading to lower interest costs, or other value-enhancing activities, the EPS dilution can be offset over time. The market's reaction to such corporate actions is typically observed in the trading activity of the company's stock. Dilip Buildcon's shares trade on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) under the symbol DBL and on the BSE Limited under the symbol 540047. The successful conversion of warrants can also be interpreted as a positive signal, indicating that warrant holders (in this case, Quanterra Stratergies LLP and Spectrum Edge LLP) have confidence in the company's future prospects and find it beneficial to convert their warrants into equity ownership. The infusion of Rs. 27.53 crore will bolster the company's financial resources for its ongoing and future infrastructure projects.

Dilip Buildcon in its post-earnings call, re-iterated its strategy “DBL 2.0”, wherein their main focus will be to strengthen the balance sheet, become net debt free in the upcoming two years, maintain consistent cash flow, deliver growth (improving ROE, ROCE ), and build client reach in different geographies. Its long-term Alpha Alternative (AA) deal is on track. According to this deal, AA will invest Rs 2,000 crore over 12-18 months across DBL through 1) the acquisition of a 10 percent stake in DBL through preferential allotment of warrants Rs 530 crore, 2) 26-percent stake in 18 hybrid annuity model (HAM) projects. DBL received Rs 133 crore from AA against 16.23 crore of convertible warrants issued at Rs 328 per warrant; the balance 75 percent of Rs 399 crore will be done within 18 months of date of allotment (by Jun'25). The infra company aims to become net debt-free by FY26. This will be led by internal accruals, divestment proceeds, and working capital days reduction, said IDBI Capital in its report.

As part of the deal, Alpha and its other entities will pick up a 10% stake in Dilip Buildcon via warrants at ₹328.05 per warrant. This will translate into an infusion of ₹530 crore into the company via warrants. Separately Alpha will also pick up a 26% stake in 18 road assets under the InvIT route. The remaining 74% stake will be held by DBL. Dilip Buildcon expects Alpha to bring in ₹700-800 crore worth of capital through warrants and InvIT during fiscal year 2024 and the remaining ₹1200-1300 crore in FY2025. ""DBL is getting ₹2000 crore capital and 4000 crore worth of invIT units which will translate into cash of ₹400 crore per year. Our idea is seeing the EPC business giving us regular business, taking the invested capital back into the company and setting up a long term revenue stream through our InvIT. As our EPC business keeps growing and PPP projects keep on increasing, we will keep adding more units to this one InvIT,"" said Rohan Suryavanshi, head of strategy, DBL during the analysts' call on Wednesday. The fundraising is in line with Dilip Buildcon's overall debt reduction plan that was laid down earlier. It plans to be a zero-net debt company by fiscal year 2025. ""We have reduced ₹300 crore of debt from FY23 levels and our own target to reduce ₹800-1000 crore from FY23 to FY24 as stated earlier. That will take our net debt to ₹1300-1500 crore by end of this financial year. Our target is to make DBL a net debt free company by next financial year,"" said Suryavanshi. ""We have taken a conservative approach going forward. We will focus on improving cash flows, reducing capex and monetising our assets,"" he added. Dilip Buildcon’s order book stood at ₹23,988 crore at the end of June quarter, and this comprises roads and highways, mining, irrigation, water supply, tunnel projects, metro projects and special bridge projects. Suryavanshi said the company is not looking to grow at a pace of 25% year-on-year. ""The order book will grow commensurately to what revenue we want to do. We will look at having ₹10,000 crore of order every year,"" he added. ""Road sector is looking robust. Good investments are coming in for the companies and projects in this sector. Activity is happening on the ham and EPC. On the BOTs side not many awards are being given by NHAI off late,"" said Jagannarayan Padmanabhan, senior director - transport logistics and mobility, CRISIL Catch all the Business News , Corporate news , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

Dilip Buildcon,"Dilip Buildcon, a top Indian highway builder, sees Infra push doubling sales",https://www.livemint.com/news/india/dilip-buildcon-india-s-top-highway-builder-sees-infra-push-doubling-sales-11614682356471.html,"Dilip Buildcon Ltd., one of the top highway builders in India, expects revenue to double in the next 4-5 years on an infrastructure push by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government, Rohan Suryavanshi, the company’s head of strategy & planning, said in an interview with Bloomberg TV. “We should be looking at 15%-20% growth year-on-year, which will lead us to double our sales in next 4-5 years,” he said. “We should be looking at an increasing order book.” India announced the highest ever outlay of ₹1.18 trillion ($16 billion) for the development of highways and roads in its 2021-22 budget. A custom Bloomberg gauge of Indian road builders has gained 27.6% since the budget was presented on Feb. 1 as compared to a gain of 2.99% in the benchmark BSE Sensex. Dilip Buildcon has jumped 53% during the period. The Bhopal-based engineering procurement and construction company has focused on selling assets as soon as they near completion. The company has monetized 29 road assets in the last three years, including the sale of five under-construction road assets in August 2019 to Cube Highways and Infrastructure, a Singapore-based firm -- backed by investors including the World Bank’s financial arm, Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and I Squared Capital. It is now in talks to sell seven under-construction road assets to a global investor. The company has signed a term sheet, completed due diligence and expects to sign a sales-purchase agreement soon, Suryavanshi said, without divulging more information about the investor. “Global investors do come in at early stages of construction but the money starts coming only when assets are completed,” he said. The highway builder expects to receive ₹2,000 crore from the monetization of the Cube Highways deal and the one being negotiated as construction is completed over the next two years. Meanwhile, the company has added ten new roads in its portfolio and will also seek to sell them, Suryavanshi said in a separate call today. Global yield hungry investors including Macquarie Group, GIC, The Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Cube Highways have been chasing opportunities in India’s highway sector either through direct acquisitions or through investment in private road trusts and road builders. India’s highway sector construction and order activity picked up this financial year, which ends on March 31, despite the pandemic, according to government data. Apart from roads, Dilip Buildcon will look at forming partnerships with global investors for other infrastructure assets, Suryavanshi said, without elaborating on the type of assets. In recent years, Dilip Buildcon has received several orders for assets including railways, metro rail, tunnels, bridges and airports. Suryavanshi said that the company’s debt level had seen a slight increase last year following the pandemic but it aims to bring down its debt to equity ratio to 0.3%-0.5% from around 0.8% currently with asset sales and internal accruals.

Dilip Buildcon,"Dilip Buildcon to sell 24 road assets to Shrem Group for Rs 1,600 crore",https://www.financialexpress.com/business/industry-dilip-buildcon-to-sell-24-road-assets-to-shrem-group-for-rs-1600-crore-824029/,"Dilip Buildcon (DBL) said on Thursday it has signed an agreement with the Chhatwal Group Trust (Shrem Group) to sell 24 of its road assets. The sale is for 14 operational projects and 10 under-construction projects, for which DBL will receive about Rs 1,600 crore over the next two years. Six of these projects were recently awarded to the company under the hybrid annuity model (HAM). As of June 30, 2017, the company had already invested Rs 682 crore across all 24 projects. The company will continue to invest in the under-construction projects towards the equity portion that is required for the hybrid annuity projects. Under HAM, which was introduced in H2 of 2016, road developers need to invest 60% of the project cost (mix of debt and equity) while 40% is given as a grant by the government. Rohan Suryavanshi, director, strategy and planning, DBL, told FE the company would receive an additional Rs 4,000 crore over the next 15 years from Shrem for the operations and maintenance of the assets. “The projects already completed were part of a stable portfolio of annuity assets. For the projects that are under construction, we will continue to construct these and also maintain them, thereafter.” DBL’s consolidated debt at the moment stands at about Rs 1,700 crore. Suryanvanshi said the company would repay its lenders as well as invest in bidding for more projects. He said, “We will take a decision shortly on how best to utilise the proceeds.” This is Shrem Group’s first foray into the roads sector. The Mumbai-headquartered company has two hotels in Goa — the Novotel Goa Shrem Resort Hotel and Grand Mercure Goa Shrem Resort. It has real estate projects in Mumbai, Alibaug and Karjat (in Maharashtra), Delhi and Neemrana in Rajasthan. Delhi’s strict fuel ban on older vehicles has sparked criticism from various parties, with Trinamool Congress member Saket Gokhale urging the government to withdraw the policy. The ban, which will impact over 62 lakh vehicles, is being viewed as a ploy to benefit automakers and corporate interests. Other politicians have also slammed the move, accusing the BJP of making empty promises.",positive

Analysts at Nuvama note that BEL remains one of the biggest defence electronics manufacturers and compared to others in the space, has better visibility of elevated operating margins on higher indigenisation efforts, cost efficiencies, and a better product mix. Robust order book and project mix sensitivity: Brokerages believe that BEL’s strong order book of Rs 71,700 crore provides strong revenue visibility. However, earnings are closely tied to the timely execution of key defence programmes such as QRSAM, MRSAM, LRSAM (different types of surface-to-air missiles) and electronic warfare systems. Push for indigenisation and margin expansion potential: Continued efforts to indigenise modules, subsystems, and key components are expected to support long-term margin expansion. High base: Analysts at both Philip Capital and Nuvama note that Q4FY25 revenue growth is likely to be muted at just 4 percent YoY due to a high base. Despite revenue momentum, EBITDA margins are expected to remain range-bound, reflecting steady but constrained profitability in the near term. Order pipeline and working capital management: Analysts at both Philip Capital and Nuvama observed that management commentary on the large order pipeline will be a key factor. Additionally, MOSL underlines the importance of increasing export contribution and maintaining a healthy working capital cycle, especially considering BEL's significant government-linked receivables.

At 10.20 am, shares of IRB Infra were trading at Rs 52.19 on the NSE. Including today's fall, the stock is now down over 21 percent in the last three months. The company's revenue fell a little over 9 percent on year to Rs 158.6 crore, compared to Rs 174.5 crore in the same quarter of the previous fiscal. The decline in revenue was on account of a heavy monsoon season. Despite a fall in revenue, the company reported a 4.3 percent increase in consolidated net profit, at Rs 99.8 crore, up from Rs 95.7 crore in the same quarter last year, supported by higher operating margins. Follow our market blog to catch all the live action The operational performance also improved as EBITDA margins expanded to 48.3 percent, up from 45.6 percent a year earlier, reflecting efficiency gains that helped mitigate the challenges posed by lower revenue. As of the end of the September quarter, IRB Infra's order book stood at Rs 3.26 lakh crore, with the Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) segment contributing 12.3 percent (Rs 40,000 crore) and Operations and Maintenance (O&M) contributing 87.7 percent (Rs 2.86 lakh crore). Furthermore, the company anticipates significant ordering from the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) in the near future, given that there are 6 to 7 Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) projects and 4 Toll-Operate-Transfer (TOT) projects lined up for bidding. Moreover, over the longer term, the company is also expecting opportunities under PPP mode for BOT projects worth Rs 2 lakh crore. On the back of IRB Infra's improving outlook on ordering and likely better toll growth in H2 FY25, brokerage firm HDFC Securities retained its 'add' rating on the stock with a price target of Rs 69.

IRB Infrastructure,IRB Infrastructure Developers share price jumps over 4% after promoter's stock buying move. Details here,https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/irb-infrastructure-developers-share-price-jumps-over-4-after-promoters-stock-buying-move-details-here-11737101369130.html,"Shares of IRB Infrastructure Developers witnessed a strong uptick on Friday, January 17, climbing over 4 per cent after the company’s promoter disclosed the release of a substantial share encumbrance. This development bolstered investor confidence, reflecting positively on the stock's performance in an otherwise weak market. The rally in IRB Infrastructure’s stock was triggered by a filing submitted by Sudha Dattaray, one of the company’s promoters. The disclosure, made under Regulation 31(2) of SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations, 2011, revealed the release of encumbrance on 28.4 lakh shares. These shares represented approximately 0.047 per cent of IRB Infrastructure's total equity. Dattaray holds a total of 50.59 lakh shares in the company, equating to 0.08 per cent of the total equity. Of these, 35.90 lakh shares, or 0.059 per cent of the equity, were pledged. The latest disclosure confirms that the majority of the pledged shares have now been released, leaving only 7.5 lakh shares—or a mere 0.01 per cent of the company’s total equity—still encumbered. The filing indicated that the shares were initially pledged for personal borrowing purposes. Jio Financial Services was named as the entity in whose favour the shares were encumbered. The release of such a significant portion of the pledged shares signals a positive move by the promoter, alleviating concerns about financial stress or over-leverage. The release of encumbrances often indicates reduced financial obligations on the part of promoters, which is generally seen as a positive signal by the market. The stock climbed as much as 4.2 per cent to its day's high of ₹54.78. It is now 30 per cent away from its 52-week high of ₹78.05, hit in June 2024. Meanwhile, the stock has advanced 22 per cent from its 52-week low of ₹44.96, recorded in January 2024. In the last one year, the stock has gained 15.5 per cent while lost 4.5 per cent in January so far after 2 straight months of gains. IRB Infrastructure Developers reported a 4 per cent increase in consolidated net profit to ₹99.86 crore for Q2FY25, compared to ₹95.74 crore in the year-ago period.

Despite heavy monsoons causing temporary traffic disruptions, the company highlighted robust toll collection growth, reflecting steady operational performance. Management expressed confidence in maintaining growth despite weather-related challenges, citing the resilience of its asset portfolio.

The firm posted a net profit of Rs. 141 crores in Q3FY23 as opposed to Rs. 73 crores in the same quarter last year, a 94% YoY growth. A 5% YoY increase from Rs. 1,498 crores in the corresponding quarter of FY22 brought the total income for the same period to Rs. 1,570 crores. In comparison to Q3FY22, when IRB Infra's EBITDA was ₹957 Cr, it was ₹801 Cr in Q3FY23, a decline of 16%.

IRB Infrastructure Developers, an engineering and development firm, has also announced a 10:1 stock split. IRB Infra has set Wednesday, February 22, 2023 as the record date to determine shareholders' eligibility for the aforementioned corporate action. Find out from the experts of various brokerage companies what individuals should do with the stock after the stock split announcement and the net profit double in Q3. The research analysts of Kotak Securities said in a note that “IRB’s results reflected improved performance across EPC and toll collections. Healthy toll collection and commencement of work at Ganga Expressway to scale up consolidated revenues further. Ordering activity has remained weak for the sector. We cut estimates by 3% on lower ordering assumptions and retain an SoTP-based Fair Value to Rs340 on roll forward to March 2025 estimates. We cut our estimates by 3% to take into account lower ordering and amortization charges. Net of roll forward, we maintain our Fair Value of Rs340 based on SoTP, valuing the core business at 7X EV/EBITDA on March 2025 estimates. Retain BUY.” The research analysts of HDFC Securities said “IRB reported revenue/EBITDA/APAT of INR 15.1/7.4/1.4bn, (behind)/ahead of our estimates by (0.5)/7.1/32%. EBITDA margin came in at 49.2%, beating our estimate of 45.7%. Consequently, APAT came in at INR 1.4bn (+94.5%/+3.2x YoY/QoQ a 32% beat). IRB refinanced the project loan for another private InvIT SPV through the issuance of NCDs with fixed coupon rate of 8.9% p.a. As of Dec’22, the order book (OB) stood at INR 191.2bn (~3.2x of FY23E revenue). The consolidated gross debt reduced to INR 126.7bn vs. INR 127.1bn, as of Sep’22. IRB expects to infuse equity of INR 2/7/2bn in Q4FY23/FY24/FY25. It guided for order inflow (OI) of INR 60-80bn for Q4FY23 and a construction revenue of INR 45bn for FY23. We maintain ADD rating on the stock with an increased SOTP target price of INR 306/sh as we roll forward to Dec-24 estimates. EPS change is reflective of a better margin on improved toll.” The research analysts of Motilal Oswal said “IRB’s order book is strong at INR191b (incl. O&M). IRB received appointed date for the Ganga Expressway project during 3QFY23. As some of these large projects move into execution, we expect EPC growth to improve going ahead. We increase our PAT estimates for FY23/FY24 by 3%/10%, respectively. We reiterate our Neutral rating with an SoTP-based TP of INR295.” The research analysts of Anand Rathi said “Construction at the recently appointed Ganga Expressway stabilising, and as the post-Q3 appointment of Chittor-Thachur hybrid annuities pave the way for this project to start contributing, the stage seems set for better scale in the immediate future. The current core-project OB, though, good for the near-term, needs to be augmented at the earliest. Management, citing healthy prospects, is sanguine of adding to keep growing. The BOT-toll division continues to benefit from rising traffic and periodic rate-revisions. The ongoing commitment to check capital intensity (and churn assets for more growth) stays, and the recent monetisation of a hybrid annuity, thus, is an augury. On the reassuring outlook, we retain our Hold rating, at a higher TP of Rs309 (on asset sale and raised estimates).” The research analysts of DAM Capital said “IRB is the only pure play road toll operator in the listed space. With the marquee new investors in company and deleveraging, we expect renewed investor interest in the sector and expect stock to re-rate over next few years. We expect growth aspirations to improve on back of large investors and a deleveraged balance sheet. Besides, the improving traffic on roads bodes well for the earnings. Increasing monetisation opportunities will further aid in increasing opportunity basket for company. We value its BOT business (including private INVIT) at Rs70bn, EPC business at Rs35bn and revise our SOTP based TP for IRB at Rs322. We maintain buy rating on stock with CMP Rs.290, with TP providing 11% upside.” The research analysts of Antique Stock Broking Ltd said “With improved credit rating, IRB Infrastructure Developers’ (IRB) finance expenses are lower than expected. And subsequently, the company is refinancing its debt. With progress on HAM project, IRB’s EBITDA margin narrows to 29%. Execution remains flat, given modest order backlog. With Modern Road Makers (MRM) execution on track, we retain our estimates. Using SoTP valuation, we value IRB at INR 329/share. We retain BUY.” On Friday, the shares of IRB Infrastructure Developers Limited closed on the NSE at ₹288.80 apiece, down by 1.05% from the previous close of ₹291.85. The stock recorded a total volume average of 1,122,195 shares and a delivery volume average of 57,557,382 shares or 51.29%.

A sharp decline in profitability and margin contraction weighed on investor sentiment, leading to a significant stock sell-off. Bikaji Foods posted a net profit of ₹28.6 crore in Q3FY25, marking a 39 percent year-on-year (YoY) decline from ₹46.6 crore in the corresponding quarter last year. The decline was largely attributed to weaker operational performance despite moderate revenue growth. Revenue increased 14.5 percent YoY to ₹714.9 crore, supported by a 3 percent rise in volumes. However, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) fell 26 percent YoY to ₹55.5 crore. The EBITDA margin contracted sharply by 425 basis points to 7.8 percent, primarily due to inflationary pressures and higher raw material costs. The ethnic snacks segment, which accounted for 62.1 percent of total revenue, witnessed a 10.5 percent YoY growth. The packaged sweets category recorded an 11.2 percent increase, contributing 18.1 percent to overall revenue. Meanwhile, western snacks revenue remained flat at 6.8 percent, whereas the papad segment posted 9.6 percent growth, making up 6 percent of total revenue. For the nine-month period ended December 31, revenue increased by 17.1 percent YoY to ₹2,008.2 crore, with a 10.9 percent rise in volumes. EBITDA for the period stood at ₹253.9 crore, reflecting a 12.6 percent margin, while profit after tax (PAT) came in at ₹154.4 crore, with a net margin of 7.7 percent. Basic earnings per share (EPS) for the period was ₹6.24. Following the earnings announcement, Bikaji Foods’ stock plunged 12.8 percent to an intra-day low of ₹638.10. The stock is now over 36 percent below its 52-week high of ₹1,005, which it hit in September 2024. However, it remains 34 percent above its 52-week low of ₹475.50, recorded in March 2024. Despite gaining 30 percent over the past year, the stock has been under pressure in recent months. It has declined nearly 5 percent so far in February, marking its fifth consecutive month of losses. In January alone, it shed over 11 percent. Catch all the Business News , Market News , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

Bikaji Foods,Bikaji says ‘not for sale’ amid investor interest in Indian snacks market,http://livemint.com/companies/news/bikaji-says-not-for-sale-amid-investor-interest-in-indian-snacks-market-buyout-offers-expand-business-ratan-agarwal-plan-11724824849193.html,"Indian snacks maker Bikaji Foods is ""not for sale"" and is instead on the prowl itself, aiming to cash in on the growing appetite for savoury brands in the world's most populous country, a top executive told Reuters. The Indian savoury snacks sector has ballooned in recent years as consumers splurge on packaged foods. ""Bikaji is not for sale. Whatever price someone offers, there are certain things that are not for sale,"" Chief Operating Officer Manoj Verma said earlier this month, without disclosing whether the company has received buyout offers. His comments came after India's Tata Group and a consortium including Blackstone and Singapore's GIC held acquisition talks with market leader Haldiram's. Shares in Bikaji, which is majority-owned by founder Shiv Ratan Agarwal and his family, have gained around 67% to value the company at $2.55 billion since Reuters reported on investor interest in Haldiram's last September. Haldiram's itself was in talks to acquire a majority stake in peer Prataap Snacks in January. ""Suddenly, this has become a hot space,"" Verma said, adding that he expects the entry of heavyweight investors to make the market more competitive and fuel further growth. Reuters reported in May that talks between Tata and Haldiram's had ended, while it is not immediately clear if other deal talks are still ongoing. Bikaji, which recently bought stakes in Bhujialalji and Ariba Foods, aims to make more acquisitions only if they could help expand distribution or boost its presence in the frozen-food market, he said, adding that it has a budget of 1 billion rupees to 1.5 billion rupees (around $12 million-$18 million) for the right target. The snacks maker, which brokerage Anand Rathi said is the third biggest Indian snacks brand behind Haldiram's and Balaji, is more focused on expanding its market share by 50 basis points every year from 9% currently. Verma expects Bikaji's revenue to rise 16%-17% in the current fiscal year from 23.29 billion rupees in the year ended March 31.

The focus markets include the states of UP, Punjab, Haryana, Chhattisgarh, Telangana, and Karnataka where the company is trying to establish and improve its presence.

Bikaji Foods operated at a margin of 17 percent (incl. PLI benefits) for FY2024 with profit margins of 11.3 percent whereas Prataap Snacks operated at 8.7 percent with profit margins of 3.3 percent for FY2024. Bikaji Foods generated an ROE of 21.6 percent in FY2024 compared to that of 7.3 percent for Prataap Snacks. Bikaji Foods trades at a P/E of 63 compared to Prataap Snacks trading at a P/E of 38. Such disparity in margin profile and return ratios has led to the market giving a premium to Bikaji Foods, it rationaled. The brokerage warned that the company operates in a very highly competitive industry with multiple national as well as local players operating in each region of the country. The Indian market is a price-sensitive market and therefore, fluctuations in the raw material prices cannot be easily passed through to the customers leading to pressure on profit margins. Rising health awareness in the country may steer people away from these ethnic snacks due to their high carbohydrate and fat content and low nutritional value, it added.

Net profit plunged 39 percent on year in Q3 to Rs 28.6 crore, down from the Rs 46.6 crore that it clocked in a year ago. The bottomline was also adversely affected by a weak operational performance in the quarter gone by.

This weighed on the company's EBITDA margins eroding it by 257 basis points compared to the same quarter last year. However, revenue grew 14.5 percent on-year Rs 714.90 crore, driven by a 3 percent increase in volumes. At 09.48 am, shares of Bikaji International were trading at Rs 649.40 on the NSE.

PNC Infratech,Buy PNC Infratech; target of Rs 386: Geojit Financial Services,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/buy-pnc-infratech-target-of-rs-386-geojit-financial-services-13105324.html,"Geojit Financial Services research report on PNC Infratech PNC Infratech Ltd. (PNC) is an infrastructure construction, development and management company with the expertise in execution of projects including highways, bridges, flyovers, airport runways, industrial areas, and transmission lines. The order book remains robust at Rs 17,792cr, which is 3.2x FY25 revenue, providing strong visibility for the coming years. Given the removal of the NHAI ban, the company is now eligible to bid for NHAI, & MoRTH projects and the management is expected to add Rs15,000cr of order inflows in FY26. In Q4FY25 PNC’s revenue declined by 39.6% YoY (in-line with our estimate) due to slow progress in execution on account of delays in getting appointed dates. Consequently, EBITDA margin during the quarter declined by 70 bps YoY to 12.4%. However, the management expects the revenue to grow by 20% YoY with an EBITDA margin of 13%. PNC is also focusing on expanding its order book to the railway and water segments. Currently, the water & canal segment constitutes 17% of the order book. We expect this disinvestment and objective to diversify to other infra segments will augur well for the growth prospects. Ample opportunities in both road and non-road projects (Rs.90,000cr) with a strong balance sheet will aid in rerating. We therefore maintain a BUY rating with a target price of Rs 386, based on a P/E of 14x FY27 EPS and HAM assets at 0.5x P/B.

During 1QFY25, the overall highway construction stood at 1,288km versus 1,465km in 1QFY24 due to elections, extreme heat and unavailability of labor, said Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities .

PNC Infratech reported weak Q4 earnings. However, some experts point out the company's bright growth outlook and the stock's attractive valuation, which suggests one can consider buying it at the current juncture. Axis Securities maintained its buy call on the stock but raised the target price to ₹340 from ₹300 earlier, citing the company's robust order book. Axis expects the company to deliver a revenue growth of 20 per cent CAGR over FY25-27E. ""A boost in the infrastructure sector is expected with a pick-up in awarding activity and the recent allocation of ₹2.8 lakh crore to MoRTH in the Budget 2025-26. We expect the company to report revenue growth of 25 per cent in FY26, backed by a robust and diversified order book, strong order inflow, especially after the closure of the MoRTH ban, a debt-free balance sheet, and favourable government support,"" said Axis Securities. Brokerage firm JM Financial maintained a buy call on the stock but cut the target price to ₹450 from ₹470 earlier. The brokerage firm pointed out that about 66 per cent of the current backlog is under execution, and the entire backlog is expected to be executed by September 2025. JM Financial underscored that PNC has guided for 20 per cent revenue growth, which implies 30 per cent growth over the adjusted base of the previous year, and expects EBITDA margins of 13 per cent for FY26E. ""Given the delay in receipt of appointed dates, we have lowered revenue, leading to an EPS cut of 4 per cent and 3 per cent in FY26E and FY27E, respectively. Valuations at 11 times and 9.5 times FY26E and FY27E, respectively, EPS (earnings per share) remain attractive. We value EPC business at 13 times FY27 EPS and assets at ₹59 to arrive at SOTP-based revised price target of ₹450,"" said JM Financial. Nuvama Institutional Equities has maintained a hold call on the stock and slightly increased the SotP-based target price to ₹286 from ₹281 earlier. ""While PNC’s operating performance has remained soft, improving balance sheet health and higher other income compel us to revise FY26E and FY27E EPS upwards by 14 per cent and 12 per cent, respectively, and PE multiple to 8 times from 7 times earlier,"" Nuvama said. While the stock appears to be a good long-term bet, some technical experts believe investors may consider booking some profits at this juncture. Jigar S. Patel, Senior Manager of Equity Research at Anand Rathi Share and Stock Brokers, highlighted that PNC Infratech stock is encountering resistance near the R1 floor of the monthly Camarilla pivot, in the ₹318–320 zone. ""A decisive close above ₹320 could open the path toward the ₹340 mark. Considering the resistance, this may be an ideal point to book partial profits,"" said Patel.

Infra Engineering, PNC Infratech and IRB Infrastructure Developers share prices are gaining traction as order inflows that were subdued in the first quarter of FY25 due to general elections are showing signs of improvement. Ashoka Buildcon, Dilip Buildcon, KNR Constructions, GPT Infraprojects, and H.G. Infra Engineering share prices among others have risen up to 8% in the last one month. IRB Infrastructure Developers share prices, however, are exceptions as they have corrected during the same period. That said, IRB Infra has already gained significantly in last one year with the stock almost doubling in price. After such stellar gains, some profit-taking is expected. Analysts say order inflow improvement has been visible in the last few months. Vinay Kumar G, Vice President & Sector Head - Corporate Ratings, ICRA Limited, said that the awarding activity gained traction sequentially, with 589 km awarded in August 2024 (up 27% month-on-month over July 2024). However, overall awarding activity remains lower by 7% as compared to August 2023. Also during the first five months of FY2025, the road awards stood at 1152 km, 34% lower than the 1756 km awarded in 5M FY2024. ICRA estimates road awards by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) at 8,500-9,000 km in FY2025, similar to last year’s awarding of 8,581 km. With improved clarity regarding order-awarding activity from the MoRTH in August 2024, project awarding is expected to gain momentum from September 2024 onwards. However, the overall project award will remain substantially lower than that of FY2021-FY2023 levels, added the rating agency.

Construction at the combined level stood at 600 km during the month. The competition, however, remains high and there are some concerns about the margins of these firms. Given the backdrop, Nuvama analysts say that road developers must work on segmental diversification since their ability to win adequate road orders at desired margins is now under question.

The new indicative date for the transaction's completion is now September 30, 2025, extended from the previously set June 30, 2025. This extension has been mutually agreed upon with the proposed investor, Maple Infrastructure Trust.Transaction Extension DetailsParticularsDetailsCompanyAshoka Buildcon LimitedSubsidiary InvolvedAshoka Concessions Limited (ACL)Assets Being SoldEntire share capital (including repayment of shareholder loans) in 5 subsidiaries of ACLProposed InvestorMaple Infrastructure Trust (formerly Indian Highway Concessions Trust)Original Indicative Completion DateMarch 31, 2025 (as per Oct 30, 2024 announcement)First Extended Completion DateJune 30, 2025 (as per March 31, 2025 letter)New Indicative Completion DateSeptember 30, 2025Reason for ExtensionFew conditions precedent are in the process of being completedAction DetailsThe corporate action pertains to the ongoing process of Ashoka Buildcon's divestment strategy through its material unlisted subsidiary, Ashoka Concessions Limited (ACL). The transaction involves the sale of the entire share capital, along with the repayment of any shareholder loans, held by ACL in five of its key subsidiaries. These subsidiaries include Ashoka Highways (Bhandara) Limited, Ashoka Highways (Durg) Limited, Ashoka Belgaum Dharwad Tollway Limited, Ashoka Sambalpur Baragarh Tollway Limited, and Ashoka Dhankuni Kharagpur Tollway Limited. The buyer for this significant stake disposal is Maple Infrastructure Trust, which was previously known as Indian Highway Concessions Trust. This strategic divestment is part of a broader corporate initiative, the details of which were initially communicated to the stock exchanges on October 30, 2024, when ACL entered into share purchase agreements and other transaction documents with the Proposed Investor.Process and TimelineThe journey towards the completion of this transaction has seen several adjustments to its timeline. Initially, when the share purchase agreements were signed on October 30, 2024, the indicative date for the fulfillment of conditions precedent and subsequent transfer of shares was set for March 31, 2025. However, as the initial deadline approached, the company found it necessary to extend this date. Consequently, via a letter dated March 31, 2025, Ashoka Buildcon informed the exchanges that the completion date had been pushed to June 30, 2025.The latest announcement, made on July 1, 2025, indicates that despite the previous extension, certain conditions precedent remain unfulfilled and are still in the process of being completed. Conditions precedent are standard clauses in M&A agreements that must be satisfied before the transaction can close. These often include obtaining regulatory approvals, securing third-party consents, or fulfilling specific financial or operational milestones. Due to the ongoing nature of these pending conditions, and following mutual agreement with Maple Infrastructure Trust, the indicative date for the transaction's closure has now been further extended to September 30, 2025. This marks the second extension for the completion of this significant divestment.Shareholder ImpactThe repeated extensions in the completion timeline for the sale of these five subsidiaries mean that the anticipated benefits from this transaction will be deferred. For shareholders, such divestments typically aim to unlock value, streamline operations, or provide liquidity for future investments or debt reduction. The delay implies that any potential cash inflows or balance sheet improvements expected from the sale will now materialize later than initially projected. While the company has not provided specific financial implications of the delay, the deferral of a significant corporate action can introduce an element of prolonged uncertainty regarding the finalization of the deal and its ultimate impact on the company's financial position. Ashoka Buildcon continues to keep the stock exchanges informed of these developments, ensuring transparency regarding the progress of this material transaction.
