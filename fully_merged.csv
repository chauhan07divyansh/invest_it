International brokerage Jefferies decided to reiterate its 'buy' rating, with a price target of Rs 490 per share. The brokerage noted the NPTC's EBITDA for the quarter was higher than expectations, as NTPC's renewable energy business achieved 90 percent margin.
Further, NTPC's fixed costs under recovery was Rs 460 crore, as compared to Rs 780 crore in FY24. The brokerage added that capacity ramp-up, along with medium-term double-digit EPS CAGR remain the key drivers for re-rating.
NTPC stays Nuvama Institutional Equities' top pick in the power utilities space on inexpensive valuation despite the brokerage estimating a seven percent EPS CAGR over FY25–27E, which will be driven by ~22GW thermal/hydro/renewable energy capex and potential of rising CERC incentives.
The broking house maintained its 'buy' call, but marginally trimmed its target price to Rs 404 per share, down from Rs 412 earlier.
Motilal Oswal maintained its neutral stance on the stock due to NTPC' sluggish installed capacity
expansion over FY25-27 at both the standalone and consolidated levels, ex-NTPC Green Energy (NGEL). Additionally, the brokerage believes that the valuation for NGEL, which accounts for ~17 percent of its SOTP valuation for NTPC, will remain under pressure amid execution challenges.
""In FY25, NGEL commissioned 1.9GW, significantly below its guided capacity growth of 3GW. Lastly, we believe the FY27E dividend yield of 2.7 percent remains modest and lower than peers such as Power Gride (FY27: 3.4 percent),"" added Motilal Oswal.

",https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/tech-mahindra-shares-edge-higher-after-this-merger-update-do-you-own-11739857304066.html,"Tech Mahindra share price gained over a percent on Tuesday after the company announced a plan of merger between its two US-based subsidiaries. Tech Mahindra shares rose as much as 1.67% to ₹1,692.70 apiece on the BSE.

The IT major Tech Mahindra said that a plan of merger of Tech Mahindra Cerium Systems Inc., its wholly-owned subsidiary, with Tech Mahindra (Americas) Inc., its wholly-owned material subsidiary, has been approved by the Board of Directors of the respective companies on February 17, 2025.

The merger is subject to regulatory approvals in the country of incorporation. The appointed date of merger is February 20, 2025, Tech Mahindra said in a regulatory filing.

“The consolidation of these entities will result in reducing the number of entities in the group, optimization of operational cost and reduction in the compliance risk,” Tech Mahindra said, explaining the rationale for the amalgamation.

Tech Mahindra Cerium Systems Inc. Tech Mahindra Cerium Systems Inc. (TMCS), the transferor company was incorporated in the USA in the year 2014. TMCS is engaged in providing design services in semi-conductor industry and embedded software services. It is currently a non-operating entity.

The turnover of TMCS for the financial year ended 31st March, 2024 is $2.7 million, Tech Mahindra said.

Tech Mahindra (Americas) Inc. Tech Mahindra (Americas) Inc. (TMA), the transferee company, was incorporated in the USA in 1993, and is a wholly-owned material subsidiary of Tech Mahindra. The turnover of TMA for FY24 was $1,153.28 million.

TMA provides computer consulting, programming support services and IT Management & Consulting Services to customers in various industries including Healthcare.

Tech Mahindra Stock Price Trend Tech Mahindra share price has gained only over 1% in the past three months and the IT stock has risen by 6% in six months. Over the past one year, Tech Mahindra shares rallied 29%, and the stock has delivered 49% returns in two years.

On the technical side, Anshul Jain, Head of Research at Lakshmishree Investment and Securities, believes that Tech Mahindra shares are in a consolidation phase, signaling a potential breakout.

“Tech Mahindra stock is currently consolidating within a broader range of ₹1,600 - ₹1,750, with volumes drying up — often a sign of positive accumulation. This phase suggests that while short-term trading opportunities remain limited, long-term investors should focus on accumulating near the range’s lower end. A breakout above ₹1,750 could trigger a strong upward move, making it a stock to watch,” Jain said.

With improving fundamentals and technical strength, Tech Mahindra shares present a compelling opportunity for value investors, he added.

At 11:15 AM, Tech Mahindra shares were trading 0.92% higher at ₹1,680.25 apiece on the BSE.",positive

Scheduled for April 24, the buzz comes at a time when major IT players like TCS, Infosys, and HCL Tech have already declared their payouts, setting the tone for the earnings season.

Let’s take a look at what is lined up, what happened last quarter, and how the stock has performed recently.

Tech Mahindra Q4 results on April 24

Tech Mahindra has announced that its Board of Directors will meet on April 23-24 to approve the financial results for Q4 and the full fiscal year. Alongside, the board will also consider recommending a final dividend for FY25.

“Tech Mahindra Ltd, a specialist in digital transformation, consulting, and business reengineering services, will announce its audited results for the fourth quarter and year ended 31st March 2025 on 24th April 2025,” the company said through an exchange filing.

Tech Mahindra dividend diaries: What’s the pattern?

If past payouts are any hint, Tech Mahindra could continue to reward its shareholders. Just last October, the company declared an interim dividend of Rs 15 per share. Before that, it paid a final dividend of Rs 28 in July 2024, and another interim dividend of Rs 12 in November 2023. In July 2023, shareholders pocketed Rs 32 per share as final dividend. The company even threw in a Rs 18 special dividend back in 2022.

Looking back: Tech Mahindra Q3FY25 numbers

Tech Mahindra’s Q3FY25 net profit nearly doubled, surging 92.6% to Rs 983.2 crore from Rs 510.4 crore in the same period last year.

Revenue saw a modest rise of 1.4%, but what really stood out was the EBITDA which rose a whopping 57.8% at Rs 1,809 crore.

Tech Mahindra’s stock performance

Ahead of the Q4 results, Tech Mahindra shares have had a bit of a rollercoaster ride. Over the last five trading sessions, the stock jumped over 11%. But zoom out a little and the story shifts, down 1% in the past month, and 15% lower year-to-date.

Over a one-year period, though, the stock is still up 20%. Its 52-week high was Rs 1,807.7, and the low was Rs 1,172.8. On Wednesday. In today’s trading session, the share price of Tech Mahindra ended the day at 1,442, up nearly 5%.",positive

HYDERABAD (Reuters) - Indian software services exporter Tech Mahindra reported a smaller-than-expected fourth-quarter revenue on Thursday as weakness in communications and hi-tech verticals continued to drag the company's revenues.

Consolidated revenue rose 4% to 133.84 billion rupees ($1.57 billion) year-on-year in the quarter ended March 31. Analysts, on average, expected revenue to come in at 134.52 billion rupees, as per data compiled by LSEG.

On Friday, Bengaluru-based Wipro reported a sharper dip in business compared to smaller peer Tech Mahindra—both disclosed third-quarter results after market hours. Wipro’s revenue totalled $2.61 billion, down 2% sequentially. Much of this decline was on account of weak business in Europe, which makes up 27% of the company’s revenue.

Still, the company did not perform as bad as expected. A Bloomberg survey of 27 analysts had estimated Wipro to report a revenue of $2.59 billion.

For Pune-based Tech Mahindra, revenue came in at $1.57 billion for the three months through December, down 1.38% from the preceding quarter. The contraction was driven by telecom companies, which make up a third of its topline.

Even though this was the company’s worst third quarter performance in at least five years, it was still better than expected. Analysts polled by Bloomberg forecast Tech Mahindra to report a revenue of $1.56 billion.

A revenue decline at Wipro and Tech Mahindra implies that three of India’s top five IT services companies have now ended the three months through December 2024 with a sequential revenue decline.

IT services rivals Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, the country’s largest information technology (IT) services company, reported $7.54 billion in revenue in Q3, a 1.7% decline on a quarterly basis.

However, the mood was better at second-largest Infosys Ltd and third-largest HCL Technologies Ltd. Infosys reported a revenue of $4.94 billion, up 0.92% sequentially; whereas HCLTech's revenue rose 2.55% to $3.53 billion.

Also read | Indian IT services companies shed reliance on H-1B visas

Both Wipro and Tech Mahindra reported client slippages, with the number of active clients declining on a yearly and sequential basis for both the companies.

Another similarity is the new leadership. Wipro picked Srinivas Pallia as its new chief executive in April last year, while Tech Mahindra appointed Mohit Joshi as CEO in December 2023. Both bosses are trying to change the fortunes of the respective companies, which ended last year with a revenue decline.

Their work reflected in the margin performance of their companies.

Wipro and Tech Mahindra fared better than peers save HCLTech in a seasonally weak quarter. For Wipro, operating margins grew 80 basis points to 17.5%, whereas for Tech Mahindra, profitability came in at 10.2%, up 60 basis points.

One basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point.

“We attribute this gain to efficient delivery, to pricing excellence and to cost optimization under Project Fortius,” said Joshi in a post-earnings interaction with the media on Friday.

Tech Mahindra had initiated a three-year plan in April last year, called Project Fortius, to expand its margins to 15% by March 2027 and grow faster than peers.

""Both companies have delivered well on the margins front,” said Manik Taneja, executive director of IT services at Axis Capital. “While operating margins at Wipro expanded on the back of operational efficiencies; at Tech Mahindra, continued improvement in margins is re-enforcing our confidence on the multiyear transformation ahead.""

Save for HCLTech, which gets a big chunk of business from software subscription renewals, the third quarter is seasonally weak for IT services companies because of holidays which result in lesser working days.

While Tech Mahindra does not offer guidance for the future, Wipro expected the company to end the fourth quarter with IT services revenue between $2.6 billion and $2.66 billion. This means that even if Wipro reports the upper-end of its estimate in the fourth quarter, it is likely to end the 12 months through March 2025 with a second consecutive full-year revenue decline.

Still, Wipro’s management was optimistic.

“If you look at 2025, we are more hopeful and resilient. Our clients are cautiously optimistic, and we see discretionary spending slowly coming back. While cost optimization continues to remain, we also see significant opportunities in AI spending,” said CEO Pallia in a post-earnings interaction with the media on Friday.

To be sure, none of India’s five largest IT services companies have disclosed revenues or order bookings from Gen AI.

Both Wipro and Tech Mahindra have reported a revenue decline in the April-December 2024 period. While Wipro’s revenue declined 4.15% from the year-ago period to $7.78 billion, Tech Mahindra’s revenue dropped 0.3% to $4.72 billion.

Investors abroad did not cheer Wipro’s performance. Its shares on the New York Stock Exchange were down 0.65% to $3.28 in pre-market trading as of 6:56 pm IST.

For Wipro, net profit was a silver lining. Wipro reported a net profit of $394 million, an increase of 2.3% sequentially. In contrast, Tech Mahindra reported a 22% decline in net profit to $116 million.

With this, each of the country’s four largest IT services companies have reported an increase in net profit. TCS, Infosys, and HCLTech reported a 2.6%, 3.5%, and 7.5% increase in sequential net profit, respectively.

Both Wipro and Tech Mahindra decreased their headcount this quarter. Wipro cut employee count by 1,157 people, while Tech Mahindra decreased it by 3,785 people, taking their total at the end of 2024 to 232,732 and 150,488 employees, respectively.

This means that three of the country’s five largest software services companies have ended 2024 with a quarterly decline in headcount, indicating that demand recovery for IT services is still uncertain.

Infosys and HCLTech increased headcount in the quarter by 5,591 and 2,134, respectively.",negative

Siemens India,Siemens stock crashes 10% to record biggest intraday fall since June. Here's why,https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/siemens-stock-crashes-10-to-record-biggest-intraday-fall-since-june-heres-why-11734690265293.html,"Stock market today: Shares of Siemens, a major player in the heavy electrical equipment sector, fell 10% in trade on Friday, December 20, hitting a one-month low of ₹6,868 per share, following the company's September quarter earnings call. The decline also marked the largest intraday drop since early June.

The company's management stated that private capital expenditure (capex) has not picked up significantly across the board. While private capex remains strong in sectors like semiconductors and batteries, it continues to lag in traditional technologies, as reported by CNBC-TV18.

Further, the management noted that the energy business is experiencing strong demand in the transmission segment, driven by a shift towards renewables, with the HVDC (High Voltage Direct Current) segment expected to be a key growth driver moving forward.

However, Siemens clarified that it is not participating in LCC (Low-Cost Carrier) tenders in India or globally, although it remains active in the VSC (Voltage Source Converter) segment.

Siemens India's digital industries business is currently facing challenges due to the ongoing semiconductor shortage and some destocking by customers, the report added.

Margins for the quarter within this segment have declined due to pricing pressures and an unfavourable product mix, according to the management, who also stated that the business is expected to recover in the coming quarters once the destocking process is completed.

Siemens manufactures and sells a range of products, including electric motors, generators, transformers, electricity distribution and control equipment, general-purpose machinery, and other electrical products, both in India and internationally. Siemens is a 75% subsidiary of Siemens AG, Germany, which operates in over 200 countries.

September quarter earnings snapshot The company, which follows a financial year from October to September, reported its quarterly numbers in late November. For the period, it posted a revenue of ₹5,894 crore, reflecting an 11% increase compared to ₹5,297 crore in the same quarter last year. The company reported a profit before tax of ₹775 crore, up from ₹534 crore in the corresponding period of the previous year.

During the quarter, the company secured new orders worth ₹6,164 crore, with strong demand across all business segments. However, Digital Industries experienced a normalisation in demand. Excluding the large ₹9,000 HP electric locomotive order from Indian Railways received in FY 2023, new orders for FY 2024 increased by 14%, according to the earnings filing.

In addition, the company announced an additional capex of ₹100 crore for the capacity expansion of its power transformer factory at Kalwa. This expansion aims to enhance the product portfolio range. As a result, the total capex for the Power Transformer factory in Kalwa is now expected to be ₹460 crore, up from ₹360 crore previously announced.",negative

Siemens
 shares were trading at around Rs 3,203.70 apiece. BofA Securities maintained an 'underperform' call on the stock with a target price of Rs 2,564 apiece. This implies a downside potential of nearly 22 percent from the stock’s previous closing price of Rs 3,284.80 apiece.

BofA Securities said that the stock, after its demerger with Siemens Energy, is expensive at 56x FY27. The global brokerage said that the core business of the company faces weak private capital expenditure. Its growth is currently driven by public capital expenditure and mobility, despite challenges in execution, it added.
The brokerage further noted that Siemens' digital margin remains under pressure, although recovery depends on mobility and smart infrastructure growth.
Siemens Energy shares made 
debut on market
 after the power transmission and distribution (T&D) firm's demerger from Siemens on June 19. Siemens Energy shares listed with strong premium at Rs 2,840 apiece, and later jumped 5 percent to hit the upper circuit at Rs 2,982 apiece.

The stock plunged 40 percent as part of price discovery for Siemens Energy and later rose 20% to trade above Rs 3,000.
The steep cut came during the price discovery trade, where the valuation of the newly formed entity was determined based on the differential between Siemens India's April 4 closing price and the opening price of Siemens Energy on Monday.
The record date for the demerger of Siemens India’s energy business was set for April 7, 2025, and the pricing process has been guided by inputs from both domestic active and passive fund managers.

Nuvama Alternative & Quantitative Research noted that Siemens Energy’s price, until its listing, should ideally reflect the valuation gap derived during the SPOS session. The firm clarified that Siemens Energy will temporarily remain in all NSE and BSE indices — including the Nifty Next 50 — at this discovered price until its listing date.
As for global passive fund managers such as MSCI and FTSE, Nuvama said no index adjustments or trading activity is expected on the record date itself, i.e., April 7. Their moves will likely follow only after the new entity lists.
The market reaction highlights investor caution as the newly formed Siemens Energy begins its journey as a separately listed entity, while clarity on its standalone valuation and index inclusion continues to evolve.

The pharma player
 reported a 23 percent jump in net profit for the three months ended March at Rs 662 crore. The firm's revenue came in at Rs 2,585 crore, higher by 12.2 percent compared to Rs 2,303 crore during the year-ago period.
The company's gross margins for the quarter stood at 62.1 percent, up 122 basis points from the previous year. The margin improvement was driven by stable raw material prices and a favourable product mix.
Despite pricing challenges in the generics portfolio (49 percent of 4QFY25 sales), Divi's has been able to exhibit ~13 percent YoY growth in API revenue, implying strong volumes. The company’s 2HFY25 witnessed meaningful recovery in the API segment after almost eight quarters of weak performance.

Should you buy, sell, or hold Divi’s Laboratories shares?
Choice Broking said it believes Divi's is well positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for CDMO in India. The Custom Synthesis (CDMO) segment remains a key growth driver, and its backward integration efforts aid margin expansion.
""The company is also on track to commercialize GLP-related contracts by CY26 or early CY27. We believe the company is well-positioned to pass on any cost increases in the event of US tariffs being implemented, and therefore do not expect any material impact on its financials,"" said the brokerage, maintaining its 'buy' call, with a price target of Rs 7,275.

International brokerage Morgan Stanley also reiterated its 'overweight' rating on Divi's Labs with a target price of Rs 7,185, citing in-line Q4FY25 results.
Antique Stock Broking upgraded its rating on Divi's from 'sell' to 'hold', hiking the price target to Rs 6,575 per share, which was previously Rs 4,150. Further, Antique revised its FY27E revenue and EBITDA estimates upward by 11 percent and 12 percent, respectively, factoring in the growing momentum in the CDMO business (including contrast media) and generics APIs.
""We now model a revenue CAGR of 17 percent over FY25–27E, with an EBITDA margin expansion of ~500 bps,"" added the brokerage.
Motilal Oswal noted, ""Given its strong capabilities in the peptide space, Divi's is in a sweet spot to
garner contracts from innovator customers for upcoming opportunities. In fact, DIVI is offering the CDMO services in GLP1, GLP2, as well as GIP molecules (refer to exhibit one). In addition to this, DIVI has a product pipeline in the generics category to drive growth on an overall basis.""
The brokerage reiterated its 'neutral' rating on the stock, with a target of Rs 6,540 per share, which indicates an upside potential of four percent from current levels.

Divi's Laboratories Ltd's shares were trading nearly 3% lower on December 5 as Novartis failed to persuade a US appeals court on Wednesday to halt MSN Pharmaceuticals' proposed generic of Novartis' blockbuster heart drug Entresto.
The US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld a Delaware federal judge's August decision that found Novartis failed to prove it was likely to win a patent lawsuit against MSN over the drug, removing a roadblock for MSN's launch of what would be the first US Entresto generic.

Brokerage firm Citi suggests investors to take any correction in shares of 
Divi's Laboratorie
s as an opportunity to lap up the stock, given that its its drug pipeline and thereby growth prospects, remain strong. Citi also highlighted other catalysts like opportunities emerging for Divi's in contrast media and GLP-1 segments, which further strengthens its case.
This comes after shares of Divi's Labs slipped 3 percent in Monday's session amid uncertainty over the passage of the US Biosecure Act in 2024. The Biosecure Act was kept out of a key defence bill, which suggests a potential softening of the US's stance on Chinese biotech. As the defence bill was the most viable path for the act's approval in 2024, its failure this year could have a negative, albeit sentimental, impact on Indian CDMO players.

However, analysts at Citi are not too concerned as they believes that even while the passage of the Biosecure Act appears to have been delayed, its thesis remains intact. Biopharmaceutical companies will continue to look for diversification and will keep adding additional partners and suppliers,"" the brokerage wrote in a note.
Clearing the air on another major setback faced by the company after Entresto, a key cancer drug produced by one of Divi's clients--Novartis, lost a US ruling in favour of a generic players. This means that soon a generic version of the drug may enter the market with the potential to adversely impact its revenue potential.

Choksi, along with his nephew Nirav Modi, is a key accused in one of the largest financial frauds in Indian banking history, which they pulled off with the help of a few corrupt PNB employees.

The scam, which came to light in early 2018, not only shocked the country but also spelt trouble for PNB shareholders, who lost almost 50% of their share price value in a matter of five months. And the impact still lingers, with the stock unable to recover to the pre-fraud levels.

Also Read | Choksi arrested in Belgium: How PNB scam accused evaded capture for years

What was the PNB scam? The scam was carried out between 2014 and 2017, came to light in 2018 when the bank reported that fake Letters of Undertaking (LoUs) worth over ₹13,000 crore had been issued from its Brady House branch in Mumbai. These LoUs were used to get loans from overseas banks for companies owned by Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi—such as Gitanjali Gems, Diamond R US, Solar Exports, and Stellar Diamonds. Later, these companies were found to be fake or shell firms.

However, Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksey had fled the country before the fraud came to light. In March 2018, a special court under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) issued non-bailable arrest warrants against Mehul Choksi and others involved. Since then, Mehul Choksi has evaded arrest, only to be nabbed by the Belgian authorities on Saturday, April 12.

How did PNB shares react to the scam? The PNB scam was first officially reported by the lender in mid-February 2018, after which the stock was caught in a downward spiral. From trading at around ₹160 on February 14, PNB stock price hit the sub- ₹100 level by the end of the month, its lowest level since June 2016. Within a month of the scam coming to light, the stock had erased 40% of its value, and within six months, nearly 55%. Almost two years later, in February 2020, the stock was trading sub- ₹50.

Even today, the stock is still unable to recover to the same levels. As of the last trading price close, PNB shares were at ₹96.02 apiece.

How did PNB scam hit the PSU bank's financials? The ripple effect of the scam was also felt on the bank's books, as the lender reported a net loss of ₹13,417 crore, the biggest ever by an Indian lender, according to a Reuters report, for the March 2018 quarter. This was also a significant decline from the ₹261.90 crore profit in the same quarter the previous year. The lender set aside a higher-than-required ₹7178 crore in the three months to March 31, 2018, or half of the total ₹14,357 crore it owes other banks for the illegal guarantees. That led to a more than tripling of its total provisions from a year earlier to ₹20353 crore, according to a Reuters report.

It was only by the December 2018 quarter that PNB reported a profit of ₹247 crore, marking its first profit since the fraud incident.

What's the way ahead for PNB shares? Seven years on, analysts are largely bullish on PNB shares. According to Trendlyne, out of 16 analysts covering the stock, nine have buy ratings and four have sell calls.

Recently, in a note to investors, brokerage InCred assigned an ‘ADD’ rating to PNB, citing potential upsides from the recovery of written-off accounts and optionality from tax rate reductions.

Last month brokerage Ventura Securities also initiated coverage on the stock with a 'BUY' rating.

""Recapitalized in FY19 and FY20, PNB strengthened its financial foundation, enabling sustained growth. Since then, it has consistently outperformed key metrics, showcasing strong business expansion, improved asset quality, and higher profitability. With a disciplined risk management approach, the bank has effectively reduced NPAs while maintaining a healthy PCR,"" said Ventura in a note.

From FY24-27, PNB's net advances are projected to grow at a CAGR of 15.5% from ₹934,413 crore to ₹1,439,205 crore, while deposits are expected to rise at a CAGR of 12.4% from ₹1,369,713 crore to ₹1,944,872 crore.

This rebound follows a bullish outlook from multiple global brokerages, which see substantial upside potential for the stock as the company plays a pivotal role in India's renewable energy transition.

Macquarie has initiated coverage on Adani Green Energy with an 'Outperform' rating and a target price of ₹1,200 per share, implying a 37 percent upside from current levels. Under its bull-case scenario, the brokerage estimates the stock could rise to as high as ₹2,600—signalling a potential rally of nearly 200 percent from recent closing levels.

Meanwhile, Cantor Fitzgerald has also initiated coverage on Adani Green Energy with an 'Overweight' rating and a price target of ₹1,222, implying a 40 percent upside.

Macquarie on Adani Green stock Macquarie highlighted Adani Green Energy’s key role in India’s energy transition, targeting 50 gigawatts (GW) of renewable capacity by financial year 2030 in a bull-case scenario.

In its base case, the brokerage projects a more conservative 30 GW, driven by improved utilisation rates, advancements at the Khavda super-site, and an increasing share of higher-tariff merchant capacities. As a result, it expects a 25 percent compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) in EBITDA over the next five years.

In a bull-case scenario, Macquarie anticipates the company achieving its ambitious 50 GW renewable energy capacity target by FY30, resulting in a 40 percent CAGR in revenue and EBITDA. Macquarie noted that while the company’s heavy capital expenditure is backed by stable cash flows, funding and refinancing costs remain key risks.

The brokerage estimates that Adani Green will generate USD 1.8 billion in annual operating cash flow to support a cumulative capex requirement of over USD 10 billion through fiscal 2030. It also expects India’s power demand to grow at a CAGR of 6.0-8.5 percent between financial years 2025 and 2030, driven by rising demand from cooling appliances, data centres, electric vehicles, and green hydrogen production.

Cantor Fitzgerald on Adani Green shares Cantor Fitzgerald noted that Adani Green Energy, India’s largest renewable energy company with an 11.6 GW portfolio, is well-positioned to benefit from the country’s push toward net-zero emissions. The brokerage sees the company as a compelling investment opportunity, given its strong growth potential.

Adani Green is currently trading at 15.6 times its estimated EV/EBITDA for the financial year 2026, slightly below its peers despite higher growth potential. From financial year 2019 to 2024, the company’s revenue and EBITDA grew at a CAGR of 40.9 percent and 36.8 percent, respectively. Looking ahead, Cantor Fitzgerald forecasts revenue and EBITDA to grow at a CAGR of 21.3 percent and 25.9 percent, respectively, from financial year 2025 to 2030. By fiscal 2030, EBITDA is expected to reach USD 3.3 billion, compared to its current enterprise value of around USD 24 billion.

Cantor Fitzgerald emphasised that Adani Green remains in an early growth phase, aiming to scale operational capacity to over 50 GW by 2030, a fourfold increase. As of the first half of the financial year 2025, the company’s net debt stood at USD 6.9 billion, with an improving debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 7.14 times. The brokerage believes this financial flexibility will enable Adani Green to fund expansion through organic cash generation, reducing reliance on external debt.

Adani Green stock price performance Despite the recent uptrend, Adani Green Energy has lost 54 percent of its value over the past year. While the Adani Group stock has gained 15 percent in March so far, it has declined 22 percent in February, 4 percent in January, 21 percent in December, 17 percent in November, and 16 percent in October.

Currently, the stock is trading 60 percent below its 52-week high of ₹2,173.65, which was recorded in June 2024. However, it has rebounded 15 percent from its 52-week low of ₹758, reached earlier this month.

Adani Green Energy continues to be India's leading energy transition, with a targeted 50 GW capacity build-up by FY2030 (current capacity is at 12 GW). Therefore, Macquarie in its note expressed its forecast of Adani Green's EBITDA rising at 25 percent CAGR over the next five years, on a more conservative pathway.
Macquarie’s report highlights that although substantial capital expenditure is supported by consistent cash flow, the recent drop in Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) tariffs has been counterbalanced by a growing allocation to higher-priced merchant capacities. This strategic shift helps maintain revenue stability despite pricing pressures in long-term contracts.
Earlier this week, Fitch Ratings had sought a negative outlook to Adani Energy Solutions Limited, due to complications surrounding corporate governance and potential risks because of the ongoing US investigations.

CLSA, however, maintained an ""Underperform"" rating with a target price of Rs 351, citing weak Q3 results led by subsidiary Tata Projects, which pulled PAT down by 6 percent year-on-year. Profitability in the company’s renewable independent power producer (IPP) business was hit by lower solar and wind utilization rates and rising interest costs. Additionally, coal profit per tonne fell 17 percent year-on-year due to a decline in seaborne coal prices.

Shares of Tata Power are quiet in trade on May 15 after the company reported strong Q4FY25 results and outlined a roadmap to scale core businesses, particularly in power distribution and clean energy.
Tata Power
 said it has plans to expand electricity distribution footprint and said during the post-earning call that it intends to bid for two discoms in Uttar Pradesh - Dakshinanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam and Purvanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam - once tender documents are issued.

These discoms will be carved into six circles, with the state likely opting for a public-private partnership model, where private players will hold majority stake.
This bid for Discoms aligns with Tata Power’s broader strategy to grow its transmission and distribution (T&D) business, which contributes the most to its revenue and profit. Currently, the company serves 1.25 crore customers across Mumbai, Delhi, Ajmer, and Odisha, and is targetting a base of 4 crore over the next five years.
The company has said that it is preparing to enter the small modular nuclear reactor (SMR) space, pending legal amendments to the Nuclear Power Act that would allow private sector participation. “We are preparing with site evaluations, water arrangements, and technology reviews, but our next steps depend on legal clarity,” said MD & CEO Praveer Sinha. Tata Steel and Tata Motors are expected to be among the industrial clients for this clean energy initiative.

Tata Power also announced a capital expenditure plan of Rs 25,000 crore for FY26. Of this, 50 percent will go toward renewables, 20 percent to generation, and 30 percent to T&D. In FY25, it spent Rs 16,000 crore - lower than the targeted Rs 20,000 crore - due to delays in renewable and transmission projects.
Tata Power also plans to exit Tata Projects, the EPC arm that built the new Parliament building. “We need capital for growth in renewables, hydro, transmission, and distribution. That’s why we’ve decided not to allocate funds to non-core ventures,” Sinha said.
Tata Power posted a 24 percent year-on-year 
rise in consolidated net profit
 to Rs 1,306 crore for the March quarter, compared to Rs 1,045.6 crore in the same period last year. Revenue grew 7.9 percent year-on-year to Rs 17,096 crore, while EBITDA surged 39.2 percent to Rs 3,245.4 crore, reflecting stronger operational efficiency. Operating margins expanded to 19 percent from 14.7 percent a year ago.

Shares of pharma major Cipla recovered after falling over two percent in early trade on May 14, as the street digested the broadly bullish brokerage notes following a 
30 percent on-year jump in net profit to Rs 1,222 crore
 for the Q4FY25, and the assurance that Trump's drug pricing order will not impact Indian players.
The muted reaction in Cipla's shares also stems from the management's caution that it sees margins for FY26 and FY27 lower than present levels, as gRevlimid, a key drug fully phases out this fiscal. The US business relies on gRevlimid, and other upcoming launches may not be able to offset this pressure on margins, said market participants.

Cipla also allayed concerns that the US government's drug pricing executive order on pharma companies, aimed at lowering cost of prescription medicines, will not impact Indian generic players. Cipla MD and Global CEO Umang Vohra said, the impact will be felt on branded drugs.
""What we understand is that this is largely targeted towards branded drugs...As of now, what we understand is that this is a voluntary measure that perhaps the companies will be taking,"" Vohra said.
Cipla's revenue from operations jumped over 9 percent to Rs 6,729.69 crore in Q4FY25, which is slightly lower than the Rs 6,768 crore revenue estimated by brokerages polled by

Following the quarterly results on May 13, shares of Cipla dropped nearly 1.3 percent from the day's high but ended in the green. 
Cipla
 has seen significant volatility recently amid uncertainties around supply chain and tariff-related threats. The stock has fallen over two percent in 2025 so far, but has risen nearly 10 percent in the past one year.
Nuvama Retains 'Maintain' on Cipla
Nuvama retained a 'Maintain' rating on the shares of Cipla, with a target price of Rs 1,620 apiece. This implies an upside potential of nearly 6.6 percent over the stock's previous closing price.

The brokerage said that its quarterly revenue was in line with its estimates, while EBITDA fell 1.5 percent below predictions, owning to higher opex and employee costs. Profit after tax (PAT) however beat Nuvama's consensus estimate by 20 percent.
""Cipla is confident of outstripping IPM growth in India on the back of its chronic portfolio, trade generics business and lucrative GLP-1 opportunity in calendar year 2026. gAdvair/gSymbicort approval is a critical future trigger, which can boost our confidence. We are trimming FY26E EPS by 2% to incorporate the margin guidance,"" the brokerage said.
Choice Broking Downgrades Cipla to 'Reduce'
Choice Broking downgraded the rating of Cipla shares to 'Reduce' with a target price of Rs 1,445 apiece. This implies a downside potential of nearly 5 percent from the stock's previous closing price. The brokerage noted that while revenue grew 9 percent from Q4 FY24, it also declined nearly 5 percent from Q3 FY25. EBITDA, margins and profit after tax also recorded a sequential decline during the quarter.
""Cipla is in an investment phase, with elevated capex and R&D spend aimed at strengthening its pipeline, including Biosimilars. While this supports long-term growth, it is likely to weigh on EBITDA margins and PAT in the near term. Further, the upcoming loss of exclusivity for gRevlimid by Q4 FY26 – a key revenue contributor – may lead to a decline in North America revenue. Reflecting these headwinds, we revise our earnings estimates downward by 9% and 7.7% for FY26E and FY27E respectively,"" it said.
Nomura retains 'Buy' on Cipla
Nomura maintained a 'Buy' rating on Cipla with a target price of Rs 1,780 apiece. This implies an upside potential of over 17 percent from the stock's previous closing price. While the company's Q4 FY25 sales and EBITDA were lower than the brokerage's expectations, profit after tax beat its estimate by 17 percent. Nomura attributed this to higher-than-expected other income and lower tax rate.
""Compared with our estimates, India growth was in-line with our estimates, while South Africa and North America markets underperformed, and growth in Europe & Emerging markets and Global API were higher than our estimates,"" it said.

Marico shares have surged nearly 10.30 per cent in over a month despite weak market sentiments. The stock has given multibagger returns to its long-term investors by soaring over 150.41 per cent in five years.

Marico Q4FY25 update details During the March quarter, the sector experienced stable demand trends amidst the improving trajectory in rural and mixed trends across mass and premium urban segments.

“We expect gradual improvement in overall consumption sentiment on the back of moderating retail and food inflation as well as forecasts of a normal monsoon,” the consumer good company said in an exchange filing dated April 3.

Consolidated revenue growth moved to high-teens on a year-on-year basis, as steady growth trends across key segments was supplemented by incremental pricing interventions in the domestic business.

“The consolidated business delivered low double-digit revenue growth on a full year basis, thereby meeting the aspiration set at the start of the year. We expect to maintain the double-digit revenue growth momentum in FY26,” it added.

In the given context, the India business posted a sequential uptick in underlying volume growth with improving market shares across key franchises. Parachute Coconut Oil witnessed transient sluggishness in volumes due to titration in consumption amidst the steep rise in consumer pricing and impact of ml-age reduction in certain packs.

“We expect volumes to pick up as the stress on the consumer wallet eases, driven by the seasonal moderation in copra prices from their current unprecedented highs. The brand recorded high teen revenue growth, aided by pricing interventions taken through the current year,” Marico said.

Saffola Oils registered revenue growth in the twenties, led by pricing interventions implemented during the year. Value Added Hair Oils exhibited gradual improvement on a sequential basis led by mid and premium segments.",positive

The healthy performance was primarily driven by strong growth in the domestic business, fueled by both price hikes and increased volumes.

The company reported volume growth of 6% in its India business, which was higher than the analyst estimates of 5%. It also reported a constant currency growth of 16% in the international business.

Consolidated and domestic revenue growth, as well as underlying volume growth in the India business, reached a 13-quarter high. Domestic revenue was ₹2,101 crore in Q3, up 17% year-on-year (YoY), led by price hikes in core portfolios in response to the sharp rise in input costs.

Overall, the company reported a double-digit revenue growth, which stood at ₹2,794 crore in Q3, compared to ₹2,422 crore posted in the same period last year, marking a 15% improvement.

Among channels, MT and E-commerce (including Quick Commerce) continued to lead with high double-digit volume growth, while GT remained flat, according to the company's earnings filing.

However, gross margin contracted by 180 basis points YoY, primarily impacted by the rising trend in copra and vegetable oil prices, which was only partly offset by pricing interventions in key portfolios.

Its advertising and promotion (A&P) expenditures increased by 19% YoY, aligning with the company's strategic focus to strengthen its franchises and drive diversification. As a result, despite a 4% increase in EBITDA, the EBITDA margin stood at 19.1%, down 210 basis points compared to the previous year.

On the other hand, the volume for Parachute Coconut Oil, which contributes 33% to the company’s domestic revenue, grew by 3% in Q3. The brand recorded a 15% revenue growth, driven by pricing hikes implemented earlier this year. Another price increase of approximately 5% was introduced towards the end of this quarter, as per the company's Q3 earnings filing.

The net profit for the reporting quarter came in at ₹399 crore, an increase of 4% compared to a net profit of ₹383 crore in Q3FY24.

Meanwhile, the company declared an interim dividend of ₹3.50 per share on its paid-up equity share capital of ₹129.5 crore.

Strategic focus on core categories The FMCG sector has exhibited steady demand trends over the course of this year, supported by a recovery in rural sentiment and stable urban consumption. Retail inflation eased in December due to moderating food prices but remains at relatively elevated levels. The company expects supportive government schemes and a healthy crop season to aid consumption in the coming quarters. Measures to stimulate consumption are anticipated in the forthcoming Union Budget

Amidst the stable macro backdrop, Marico anticipates gradually improving growth trends in the core categories of its domestic business through ongoing initiatives to support select General Trade (GT) channel partners and transformative expansion of its direct reach footprint under Project SETU.

“The FMCG sector exhibited reasonably steady demand sentiment during the quarter. Retail and food inflation were at elevated levels but showed some signs of easing in December.

International Business:
 Revenue grew 16 percent in constant currency terms, but performance varied across markets. Bangladesh reported 20 percent growth on a weak base, while MENA posted a 35 percent rise. South Africa registered a 17 percent increase, but South East Asia struggled due to weak demand and geopolitical issues in Myanmar. Currency depreciation in some markets impacted earnings, leading to an estimated 2 percent hit on consolidated EBITDA.
Outlook
Marico expects demand to remain stable in the coming quarters, aided by rural recovery and government support measures. However, rising input costs could continue to weigh on profitability. “While the sharper-than-anticipated rise in input costs will have some transient impact on margins in the near term, we remain biased towards driving top quartile volume growth and double-digit revenue growth in the near and medium term,” said Saugata Gupta, managing director and CEO.

Shares of Marico fell by more than 2.5% on January 6, over concerns that a higher-than-expected inflation in copra and vegetable oil prices may have dented the gross margin of the company in Q3FY25. Marico has said it may see a modest operating profit growth this quarter as a result of expansion, and investments in brand building.
CLSA in its note has said that it is expecting a modest operating profit growth of 4.8% YoY for Marico, indicating a contraction. Still, the consolidated revenue growth for the company is expected to be in the mid-teens for Marico, as per CLSA, and the full-year revenue growth is likely to be in double-digits.

Home-grown FMCG major 
Marico 
expects to deliver a double-digit revenue growth in FY25 helped by sequential improvement with price hike and better volume, its MD & CEO Saugata Gupta said.
However, he also mentioned that as far as profitability is concerned there is inflationary pressure on the material inputs in the second half of FY25 and the operating margin should be in the ”broad region of 20 per cent” helped by a strong and institutionalised cost management system. ”If you look at the volume growth trajectory every quarter, we have sequentially improved. I think the way we look at it is that we should be able to deliver double-digit revenue growth. Our aspiration is to deliver top quartile volume growth,” Gupta told PTI.

The ”diversification journey” of Marico, where it is increasing its play in the food segment, continues to gather momentum and is doing very well, he added. ”For example, food in the last two quarters hit an annual recurring revenue (ARR) of Rs 1,000 crore. We have a digital business, and two of our digital brands have scaled. Digital businesses put together have a very low cash burn,” he said. Marico’s international business continues to be robust, reporting double-digit constant currency growth. ”And in spite of the fact that there have been some headwinds, we have been able to be resilient in some of the markets like Bangladesh,” Gupta added.
Marico has already taken a price hike in Saffola, due to an increase in the import duty on edible oil by the government last year. However, it may have another round of price hike for its coconut oil brand Parachute, depending on the copra prices. ”So, as far as Saffola was concerned, I think it was necessitated by the import duty hike. And with respect to Parachute, we have taken pricing actions and could take one more round if required,” said Gupta adding ”As we move towards Q1 of the next fiscal, we expect copra prices to begin winding down.” When asked about the current quarter, Gupta said the industry is still facing input cost inflation, though it is softening. Moreover, the tax incentives announced in the recent budget by the government would also help improve the situation on the consumption front, especially in the large urban markets.
""Food inflation is slightly easing,” he said adding ”The entire tax breaks that have been given to the middle class (in Budget) will definitely improve sentiment.” However, Gupta also added that such improvement will happen gradually. ”Some of the tax breaks are welcome and this is something which the government has done for the middle class which definitely boosts consumption. Having said that, that consumption will just not be channelised towards FMCG but different categories also. Also, I believe that food inflation is gradually softening. A combination of both should help in terms of recovery of the urban consumption,” he said.

This will also help in urban consumption definitely for beauty and personal care and foods because some of the disposable income will go towards some parts of the FMCG. ”So this should help in recovering the urban consumption,” said Gupta. In the December quarter, Marico which owns brands as Saffola, Parachute, Livon – reported a 5.2 per cent growth in net profit and its consolidated revenue from operations was up 15.35 per cent to Rs 2,794 crore. ”One of the reasons, we have been able to do well is that there has been a sequential volume growth every quarter,” he said. Marico’s core Parachute volume growth has been positive, Gupta added.",positive

The shares of Zomato-parent 
Eternal
 gained over 1 percent on June 11 after a large block deal took place on exchanges. The shares of the company were trading at Rs 258 apiece in the morning, snapping a two-day losing streak which was triggered by Rapido's foray into the food delivery business.
Nearly 60.93 lakh shares of the company, which represent 0.06 percent of its total equity, were traded in the block deal at an average price of Rs 256 per share. The total transaction was worth Rs 156 crore.

Eternal shares had seen significant decline recently amid buzz over cab-hailing platform Rapido's entry in the food delivery business with significantly lower commission charges. The shares of the Zomato-parent, along with rival Swiggy, tumbled after reports claimed that Rapido has begun onboarding restaurants for the pilot food delivery project in Bengaluru.
Rapido will charge a 
flat delivery fee of Rs 25
 plus goods and service tax (GST) for all food orders above Rs 100 within the standard 4 kilometre radius. However, for all food orders that are worth Rs 100 and below within the same distance, the delivery cost will be Rs 20. Zomato and its rival Swiggy currently have platform fee, packaging charges, GST on such costs, delivery fee and more, which cumulatively push up prices.

According to its pitch to restaurateurs, a copy of which 
Moneycontrol
 has reviewed, Rapido is naming its food delivery segment as 'Ownly'. Rapido, in its pitch, said it enables 4 million rides in 500 Indian cities and has 30 million monthly active users, which positions it as a strong challenger brand, especially given its scale.
Rapido is also ensuring that online prices are at par with prices offline. ""We will only be looking to work with partners who can commit to this stand of honest pricing,"" Rapido said in its proposal. ""The price of a dish (excluding GST) is the final price the customer pays. There is no other addition from us or a restaurant partner. Offline price = Online price,"" it added.
Food delivery giants 
Swiggy and Zomato may face a valuation cut to the tune of 20 percent
 if Rapido manages to execute well after entering the segment, according to Karan Taurani, Executive Vice President at Elara Capital.

""Since the last three-four years, Zomato and Swiggy have maintained a duopoly over the segment. So the entry of a new player does come as a surprise,"" Karan Taurani told CNBC-TV18. He noted that Rapido has a logistical advantage over the other players due to its already existing fleet of nearly four million scooter riders all across the country.
While noting that Rapido has chances to succeed in the segment, Taurani noted that execution is key. ""Unless the consumer experience is not as enhanced like Swiggy and Zomato, you will not see Rapido scaling up,"" he said during the media interaction.
When asked if Zomato and Swiggy may face a risk from Rapido's lower commission model for restaurants, Taurani said that the risk may emerge only if Rapido executes well. ""We can't say that things are going to be worse for Zomato and Swiggy right now, because it is very early days to call them out. We will have to monitor what is the kind of customer traffic Rapido is generating, how many orders they are able to deliver, how many riders do they have, how they are improving their customer experience and more,"" he said.
While Zomato shares snapped its losing streak to trade in the green, its rival 
Swiggy
 saw its shares extend losses for the third consecutive session. The stock was trading in the red with marginal losses.

Food delivery major Eternal Ltd. - formerly known as Zomato - saw its shares sink over three percent during the opening session on Monday, May 26, after the internet company is slated to see passive outflows nearing $840 million as global index majors FTSE Russell and MSCI prepare to trim Eternal's weightage in their portfolios, said IIFL Capital Services.
The changes follow a sharp reduction in the 
Eternal
's foreign ownership limit (FOL), which was brought down from 100 percent to 49.5 percent. That move has effectively capped the extent to which overseas investors can hold the stock, forcing index providers to recalibrate its representation.

On Friday, FTSE announced changes in the investability weight of Zomato, while MSCI is likely to make changes during its May review. The stock currently figures in several of FTSE’s prominent indices, including the FTSE All-World Index, the FTSE MPF All-World Index, the FTSE Global Large Cap Index, and the FTSE Emerging Index.
FTSE’s rebalancing alone could lead to passive outflows of about $380 million, or roughly Rs 3,235 crore, IIFL estimated. Meanwhile, MSCI’s May review — which is also expected to account for the FOL cut — could add another $460 million (around ₹3,917 crore) to the tally.
At 9.25 am, shares of Eternal were quoting Rs 229.79 on the NSE, down 3.3 percent.

Unlike routine adjustments that consider available foreign investment headroom, a direct FOL cut leads to a more abrupt recalibration, IIFL noted. The result is a full-scale reduction in investability weight in one go, rather than a staggered adjustment — intensifying the risk of near-term selling pressure.
For the quarter ended March, Eternal has reported a 78 percent YoY fall in consolidated net profit to Rs 39 crore in Q4 FY25. It had reported a net profit of Rs 175 crore in Q4 FY24. Revenue from operations however surged 64 percent YoY to Rs 5,833 crore in the fourth quarter of FY25.

Shares of foodtech and quick commerce company Eternal Ltd, parent of Zomato, rose 5.5% on June 5 amid multiple positive triggers, thus extending its two-day gain to 9%. The stock of the company was the top gainer among Nifty 50 stocks.

 were trading 5.4% higher at Rs 259 apiece. The 52-week low of the stock is Rs 179 and 52-week high is Rs 304.7. The market capitalisation of the stock is Rs 2.5 lakh crore.

So far on Thursday, over 7.2 crore shares of the company have changed hands on the NSE, sharply higher than over 3.4 crore shares traded during the same period on Wednesday.
Recently, Morgan Stanley took a bullish stance on Eternal, citing the company’s leadership in both food delivery and quick commerce, efficient cost structure, and a strong balance sheet that reduces the risk of further equity dilution.
The brokerage has maintained its price target at Rs 320, implying up to 23% upside from current levels, and sees a potential floor at Rs 200–220, offering what it calls a compelling risk-reward profile.

A key driver behind the bullish stance is the rising addressable market in quick commerce. With faster customer additions and an expanding city footprint, Morgan Stanley now estimates India’s QC market will grow to $57 billion by 2030, sharply higher than its earlier forecast of $42 billion. As a result, it has raised Eternal’s quick commerce gross order value estimates for FY26–28 by 9–11%.
Though the segment continues to face heavy competition, 
Morgan Stanley 
believes losses will peak this quarter, with margin recovery gaining pace from FY26 onward. In parallel, the food delivery business is also expected to deliver improved margins, aided by better monetisation and fixed cost absorption.
Meanwhile, a 
CLSA report
 showed that Blinkit is now within striking distance of Zomato’s food delivery app in weekly active users, signalling a major shift in India’s online shopping habits. As of May 26, Blinkit recorded 30.1 million weekly active users, just shy of Zomato’s 30.7 million, and comfortably ahead of Swiggy’s combined app user base.

This comes at a time when quick commerce is growing at a scorching pace, fuelled by rising consumer demand and aggressive expansion by players like Zepto and Swiggy’s Instamart. What started as a convenience-led experiment is fast becoming a default choice for grocery, snacks, personal care, and even fashion in some cities.
According to Sensor Tower data analysed by CLSA, Blinkit, already the category leader, has only widened its lead this year. The gap between Blinkit and its closest peer has grown from 1.79 million WAUs in early January to 7.7 million by late May, its highest ever, the report said.",positive

Online food delivery platform Zomato shares plunged nearly 7% to close at Rs 227 on January 13. This marks a fall of nearly 23% in the last three weeks for the stock.
Zomato
 shares have so far declined for the seventh straight session since January 2. The stock has fallen over 25% from its December 9 level, when it had hit its all-time-high record of Rs 304.7.

The stock currently has a market capitalisation of Rs 2.19 lakh crore, as per data on BSE. The price to earnings (PE) ratio of the stock currently stands at around 140.
The fall in Zomato’s share price accentuated after global brokerage firm 
Jefferies downgraded shares of Zomato
 to  'hold' last week, citing the sharp run-up in the stock through 2024 and concerns over rising competition in the quick commerce space.
In November, brokerage firm 
Macquarie had retained its 'underperform' call
 on the stock, despite the stock rallying during that time. The firm had then cited potential downside risks that could reduce the stock's value by around 50 percent.

Recently, Citi in its latest report had said that Zomato-owned Blinkit and Zepto have cornered a higher market share in 
India's quick commerce market
, followed by Swiggy Instamart.
""In quick commerce, Swiggy may be in the third spot in terms of market share behind Blinkit and Zepto. We estimate Swiggy’s market share at 23 percent, and Blinkit’s market share at 41 percent,"" the report said.
""The gap in unit economics and cash burn rate for Swiggy are materially worse relative to Zomato, which means there is a lot of ongoing convergence on customer acquisition pace, AOV (average order value) increase, supply chain cost reductions that Swiggy needs to deliver,"" the note stated.

Zomato,"Zomato, Swiggy shares can jump up to 127%, says ICICI Securities",https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/zomato-swiggy-shares-can-jump-up-to-127-says-icici-securities-11741076669980.html,"Swiggy share price has the potential to more than double, while Zomato share price can jump nearly 40% from current levels, according to ICICI Securities’ latest report on these quick commerce stocks.

Swiggy shares spiked as much as 7.72% to ₹351.60 apiece, while Zomato share price gained 3.42% to ₹229.65 apiece on the BSE Tuesday.

ICICI Securities reiterated its ‘Buy’ rating on Swiggy shares with a target price of ₹740 per share, implying an upside potential of 127% from Monday’s closing price. As per its SoTP-based methodology, the food delivery segment is valued at ₹99,800 crore, while the quick commerce segment is valued at ₹42,800 crore and cash balance is ₹9,000 crore.

The brokerage has also reiterated its ‘Buy’ call on Zomato shares, with a target price of ₹310 apiece, an upside potential of 40%. It values the food delivery segment at ₹1.6 lakh crore, the quick commerce segment at ₹96,600 crore and cash balance is ₹18,000 crore.

Swiggy and Zomato shares have corrected around 32% and 21% over the last three months given concerns around increasing cash burns in Quick commerce (QC). This was mostly on account of higher discounting by Zepto as it was looking to increase market share post accelerated store expansion.

“We think, however, that these concerns have been over-baked into the stock prices for both Swiggy and Zomato. We think Swiggy (consolidated) is now trading at an ~30% discount to par value for the food delivery business, implying negative value for the optionality of success in QC. Zomato on the other hand is trading at a value that ascribes nothing to QC,” ICICI Securities said in a report.

The brokerage firm thinks this anomaly is unlikely to sustain long especially given a robust outlook for discretionary consumption from May 2025.

Food Delivery: Overlooked Amid Quick Commerce Frenzy According to ICICI Securities, investor focus on quick commerce has overshadowed food delivery, despite its profitable scale-up over the past two years. While Q3FY25 saw some slowdown, structural growth remains intact. Historical data shows a rise in consumption following major tax cuts (FY06, FY11, FY13, FY14).

With income tax cuts in the FY26 Union Budget, middle-class spending is set to rise, benefiting hyperlocal e-commerce — particularly food delivery, given its discretionary nature.

Quick Commerce: Challenges Persist, But Outlook Improves Rising cash burn has led to sharp valuation discounts in quick commerce. However, ICICI Securities said its checks across top metro locations suggest peak item-level discounting (Nov’24-Jan’25) has eased, shifting towards cart-level incentives. Platforms have also reduced performance marketing spend, which could improve EBITDA contribution.

While near-term margin improvements remain uncertain, long-term valuations appear attractive for investors with a horizon of over a year, it said.

At 2:05 PM, Zomato shares were trading 1.33% higher at ₹225.00 apiece, while Swiggy shares were trading 6.63% higher at ₹348.05 apiece on the BSE.",positive

Zomato on Monday announced that its consolidated net profit for the December quarter fell by 57.2% to ₹59 crore, as its margins were impacted by rapid store expansion to accommodate orders from its quick-commerce service, Blinkit. In the same period last year, the company reported a net profit of ₹138 crore.

Zomato reported a 2% increase quarter-on-quarter and a 17% rise year-on-year in food delivery revenue, attributed to a widespread ""demand slowdown,"" as mentioned in a letter to its shareholders.

The company's consolidated revenue from operations reached ₹5,405 crore, compared to ₹3,288 crore in the December quarter of the previous fiscal year. Total expenses also surged to ₹5,533 crore, up from ₹3,383 crore during the same period of 2023-24.

Zomato share price today opened at ₹223.10 apiece on the BSE. The stock touched an intraday high of ₹227.05 and an intraday low of ₹219 per share.

Zomato Stock: Time to buy or sell? Here's what brokerages and analysts said on Zomato stock following its earnings announcement:

Tech View According to Osho Krishan, Sr. Analyst, Technical & Derivatives, Angel One, Zomato experienced a significant decline of nearly 8 per cent after the release of its Q3 earnings report.

This downward movement caused the stock price to fall below 200 SMA on the daily chart, accompanied by the formation of a strong bearish candlestick. From a broader technical perspective, the stock has broken down from a 'Double Top' formation, raising concerns about the potential for further corrections in the near term.

The next visible support is seen around the 200 subzones. Meanwhile, if the stock can manage to break decisively above the resistance levels between 245 and 250, it could invalidate the current bearish formation and restore some bullish sentiment among investors. However, until such a breakthrough occurs, the outlook remains cautiously negative, with the possibility of further declines looming in the background, believes Osho.

Fundamental View Nuvama Institutional Equities The brokerage's report indicates that the growth of Blinkit's dark store additions is exceeding expectations, contributing to accelerated growth, although profitability might experience temporary setbacks due to increased initial expenses for opening stores.

Nuvama anticipates that this accumulation of costs for adding dark stores will negatively impact short-term profitability, but it will eventually lead to a consolidation of profitability in upcoming quarters as these stores reach maturity. It maintained a 'BUY' rating with an updated sum-of-the-parts based target price of ₹300 (previously ₹325) as they transition to their FY27 projections.

Motilal Oswal Financial Services “Zomato's food delivery business is stable, and Blinkit offers a generational opportunity to participate in the disruption of industries such as retail, grocery and e-commerce. We value the business using a DCF methodology, assuming a 12.5% cost of capital. We maintain our BUY rating with a target price of ₹270, implying 13% potential upside,” the brokerage said.

In the half-year rebalancing of Sensex, Zomato replaced JSW Steel w.e.f December 23. The adjustment took place at the close of Friday, December 20.

According to Nuvama Alternative & Quantitative Research, Zomato’s inclusion in the Sensex is projected to attract passive inflows of approximately $513 million. On the other hand, JSW Steel’s exclusion is estimated to result in outflows worth $252 million.

However, Zomato share price declined as much as 3.08% to ₹273.15 apiece in early trade on Monday.

Zomato Share Price Trend Zomato share price has delivered impressive returns this year, driven by robust financial performance. Over the past six months, Zomato stock price has surged more than 43%, significantly outperforming the flat performance of the benchmark Sensex.

Year-to-date (YTD), Zomato shares have delivered multibagger returns of over 126% and has skyrocketed by 350% over the past two years.

On Friday, Zomato shares ended 2.29% lower at ₹281.85 apiece on the BSE, with a market capitalisation of ₹2,71,995 crore. Zomato’s valuation has surpassed some of the top companies such as Tata Motors, Adani Enterprises, Asian Paints, Coal India, Bajaj Auto, and others.

Zomato,"Zomato's foreign ownership cap may lead to MSCI exit, says Jefferies; stock falls 3%",https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/zomatos-foreign-ownership-cap-may-lead-to-msci-exit-says-jefferies-stock-falls-3-11747730622989.html,"Stock Market Today: Eternal, formerly known as Zomato, saw its share price decline by more than 3% in intraday trade on Tuesday, after the company announced receiving approval for a foreign ownership cap, prompting worries about possible exclusion or weight reduction in the MSCI index.

Eternal announces approval for foreign ownership cap Eternal, also known as Zomato, on Monday, post-market hours, informed the exchanges that shareholders of the company have duly passed the special resolution pertaining to the cap on aggregate foreign ownership to 49.50%.

Jefferies expectation on MSCI weightage and outflows According to Jefferies, while this development could provide flexibility to run a 1P (inventory) model for Blinkit, it raises the possibility of an MSCI weight cut or even a possible exclusion.

Jefferies said that Eternal (Zomato) has secured an overwhelming majority of more than 99% shareholder votes in favour of the proposal to convert itself into an Indian owned & controlled company (IOCC). This change, as per Jefferies, would provide flexibility to run a 1P (inventory) model for Blinkit. The capping is perhaps to protect from potential regulatory risks, even while Q/C models (Quick Commerce, referring to its service called Blinkit) conform to current law.

However, Jefferies expects that this move may result in an MSCI weight cut.

An MCSI weight cut refers to a decrease in a company's weighting within the MSCI Emerging Market Index. This also leads to certain outflows as market participant adjust their ownership in a company shares.

MSCI rule, as per Jefferies, is that for a stock where there is a cap, if the FPI holding is within 3% below the maximum permissible limit, the stock comes under the red flag list.

The exchanges/depositories would then release exact FPI holdings data every evening. If the FPI limit is breached, the foreign investor shall divest their excess holdings within five trading days from the date of settlement of trades, by selling shares only to domestic investors.

According to MSCI, switching to IOCC would likewise result in a weight reduction or total exclusion.

If foreign ownership limit is not breached prior to implementation, then in such a case, based on MSCI’s foreign ownership room calculation, Eternal could either face immediate exclusion from the MSCI index—triggering estimated outflows of approximately $1.3 billion or there would be a reduction in index weight, which as per Jefferies would be leading to outflows of around $650 million during the August-25 rebalancing.

If the foreign ownership limit was breached before implementation, this would result in a definitive exclusion from MSCI. However, the impact on liquidity from FPIs remains uncertain and is hard to quantify, added Jefferies.",negative
Zomato,"Zomato shares drop 5% after Jefferies downgrades stock, cuts target price by 18% to ₹275_x000D_
",https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/zomato-shares-drop-5-after-jefferies-downgrades-stock-cuts-target-price-by-18-to-rs-275-11736230642095.html,"Shares of food aggregator Zomato fell 5 per cent on Tuesday, January 7 after global brokerage Jefferies downgraded the stock to 'Hold', according to media reports. The brokerage also reduced its target price for Zomato by 18 per cent from ₹335 to ₹275, indicating just over 9 per cent upside potential. The downgrade comes as the brokerage believes rising competition and discounting pressures will impact the company’s profitability.

Jefferies' Concerns Jefferies highlighted concerns about intensifying competition in the quick commerce segment, where Zomato’s Blinkit faces challenges from rivals like Swiggy’s Instamart, Zepto, Amazon, and other emerging players. This competitive landscape is expected to exert pressure on Zomato’s profitability due to aggressive discounting strategies and heightened market penetration efforts by its competitors, the brokerage believes.

The brokerage firm predicted that 2025 would likely be a year of consolidation for Zomato after the stock’s impressive rally in 2024, during which it more than doubled in value. While Jefferies acknowledged Zomato’s strong operational execution and growth potential, it emphasised the risks associated with sustained discounting and competition.

In response to these challenges, Jefferies significantly lowered its earnings projections for Blinkit, reducing FY26-27 consolidated EBITDA estimates by 12-15 per cent and halving Blinkit’s target valuation multiple to 6 times. For Zomato overall, Jefferies cut FY25 EBITDA estimates by 15 per cent and FY26 estimates by 12 per cent. Profitability forecasts also saw a reduction, with FY26 estimates down 17 per cent and FY27 estimates lowered by 18 per cent. Furthermore, Jefferies reduced its earnings per share (EPS) projections by 20 per cent for FY26 and 21 per cent for FY27.

Views from Other Brokerages Despite Jefferies' cautious stance, other brokerage firms maintain a more optimistic outlook on Zomato. Morgan Stanley reaffirmed its 'Overweight' rating, assigning a target price of ₹355.

""India's quick commerce segment is gaining momentum within the retail market, supported by robust execution in food delivery and quick commerce, a solid balance sheet, and a significant profit pool projected by 2030, keeping us overweight (OW) on the stock,"" stated the global brokerage firm in its report.

Morgan Stanley's overweight rating on Zomato is underpinned by the company's advantage from a favourable industry landscape in food delivery, combined with its market leadership and superior unit economics.

Similarly, Bernstein included Zomato in its top stock picks within its Indian Strategy report, indicating continued confidence in the company’s growth trajectory.

Stock Price Performance The stock fell as much as 4.9 per cent to its day's low of ₹251.60, extending losses to the third straight session. Just in January, it has shed 9 per cent following an over half a per cent fall in December.

However, in the last one year, the stock has rallied almost 99 per cent. Notably, Zomato recently joined the 30-stock Sensex index after delivering 130 per cent returns in 2024.

Currently, the stock is over 17 per cent away from its peak of ₹304.50, hit in December 2024. Meanwhile, it has surged almost 107 per cent from its 52-week low of ₹121.70, recorded in January 2024.

Q2FY25 Financial Performance Zomato reported a robust financial performance for the second quarter of FY25 (Q2FY25). Profit after tax (PAT) soared fivefold to ₹176 crore, compared to ₹36 crore in Q2FY24. However, PAT declined by 30 per cent from ₹253 crore in Q1FY25.

Revenue from operations surged 69 per cent year-on-year (YoY) to ₹4,799 crore in Q2FY25, up from ₹2,848 crore in the same quarter of the previous fiscal year. The impressive topline growth reflects Zomato’s ability to scale its operations despite challenges in the competitive landscape.",negative

The daily chart painted a picture of uncertainty, showing a Doji candlestick that signifies a standoff among market participants, where bullish and bearish forces struggle for dominance. Accompanying this was a small negative candle, adorned with subtle upper and lower shadows, further hinting at a period of turbulent, sideways movement. Presently, Nifty 50 is hovering near an immediate support level of 24,700. Should it slip below this crucial support, it could tumble toward the next support level at 24,500-24,400 in the near term. Conversely, if it manages to break through and hold above the resistance level of 25,000, it could ignite a wave of renewed buying enthusiasm, breathing fresh life into the market atmosphere.

,"Bajaj Finance share price hits 52-week high; stock delivers with 36% returns, Rs 1.5 lakh crore value creation in 2025",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/bajaj-finance-share-price-hits-52-week-high-stock-delivers-with-36-returns-rs-1-5-lakh-crore-value-creation-in-2025/articleshow/120509667.cms,"Bajaj Finance share price hits 52-week high Bajaj Finance share price today: In a remarkable display of market performance, Bajaj Finance has outperformed its Nifty counterparts this year, generating a 36 per cent year-to-date return and creating Rs 1.5 lakh crore in investor value.The company's market capitalisation is approaching Rs 6 lakh crore, following its climb to a new 52-week peak of Rs 9,315 on Monday, signalling a significant breakthrough. Analysts are revising their price targets upwards, with CLSA setting a target of Rs 11,000, quoting, ""Form is temporary, class is permanent."" Elara Capital has raised its target to Rs 11,161, according to an ET report. Elara anticipates a 25 per cent AUM CAGR for Bajaj Finance during FY24-27, citing its robust business structure and growth catalysts. The NBFC is capitalising on favourable market conditions whilst expanding significantly in rural areas, having doubled its presence in 18 months. ""Bajaj Finance's diversification into high-growth areas such as gold loans, microfinance, and tractor loans will further bolster its growth trajectory,"" said Elara.The organisation's cross-sell operations are showing positive results, with 62 per cent of customers contributing to a per customer profit of six. Ventura Securities commenced coverage with a BUY rating and Rs 10,205 target while the recent leadership changes have reinforced stakeholder confidence.Regarding valuation considerations, OmniScience Capital's Vikas Gupta observed that Bajaj Finance's P/E ratio has increased from 26-27 in November to 35-36, approaching fair value.BNP Paribas maintained a cautious stance, noting potential market oversight of peak borrowing costs expected in Q2FY25. They predict increased provisions for stressed segments, whilst acknowledging possible sentiment impacts in Q4FY25.Nevertheless, the overall outlook remains positive, with analysts confident in Bajaj Finance's sustained growth potential, supported by its diversified operations and market leadership. Investors will monitor quarterly results closely, particularly considering rising borrowing costs and potential personal loan market changes.Stay informed with the latest business news, updates on bank holidays and public holidays.AI Masterclass for Students.

,"For Wipro, a long wait for a turnaround",https://www.livemint.com/Companies/3iQyX8U0gKQWtlQ1apWPqL/For-Wipro-a-long-wait-for-a-turnaround.html,"For Wipro, a long wait for a turnaroundWipro continues to lag rivals despite becoming more aggressive and increasing the number of big-ticket customers Pankaj Mishra, Anirban SenUpdated9 Jul 2013, 12:23 AM ISTIn the last seven quarters, for instance, Wipro&#8217;s revenue from manufacturing and hi-tech customers grew by only 7.1%, compared to more than 24% revenue growth by rivals from such clients during the same period. Photo: Hemant Mishra/Mint (Hemant Mishra/Mint ) Bangalore: Last month, top leaders of Wipro Ltd, led by chief executive T.K. Kurien and head of strategy Rishad Premji, spent two days in San Diego, US, with former head of Hewlett-Packard Co.s (HP) printing business Vyomesh Joshi, who was appointed as an independent director on the companys board last year.add_main_imageUsually, strategy discussions at Wipro happen at three levels every year, the first one where different business units present annual plans to the CEO, the second one where Kurien presents a strategy plan to the companys billionaire founder Azim Premji and thirdly, the final plan vetted by all is presented to the board around January.Meeting with Joshi, who joined HP as a young researcher in its printing division and built the companys $25 billion printing business, was not one of the usual series of strategy discussions at Wipro that take place in a normal year.NextMAdsThe agenda was to listen to Joshi and understand what strategic bets to prioritize and how, said one of the people familiar with the discussions that took place in the meeting. The person requested anonymity because the details are confidential.The company, however, still continued to lag rivals in overall growth and barring energy and utility business segment, it failed to become a leader in the fast-growing banking and financial services and manufacturing sectors. In the last seven quarters, for instance, Wipros revenue from manufacturing and hi-tech customers grew by only 7.1%, compared to more than 24% revenue growth by rivals from such clients during the same period.For years, Wipro has had the size of a tier-1 (company), but they behaved like a tier-2. And honestly, that continues today, said Peter Bendor Samuel, founder and CEO of Everest Group that advises outsourcing customers on buying services.The difference in performance is quite stark. In calendar year 2012, manufacturing vertical revenues increased merely 5% for Wipro compared to 13% for Infosys, 20% for TCS (Tata Consultancy Services Ltd)and 25%+ for Cognizant, said Viju George and Amit Sharma of JP Morgan Asia Pacific Equity Research in March this year.sixthMAdsThe report added that its the mix of business within the manufacturing and hi-tech vertical thats causing the problem. For instance, Wipros revenue from R&D business decreased 3% annually in calendar year 2012. On absolute basis, R&D revenue decreased from $182 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011 to $165 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2013. Product engineering revenues are also (almost) stagnant at $119 million (in the third quarter of fiscal year 2013) compared to $115 million in 4QFY11, the JP Morgan analysts said.In April, this year, Wipro forecast revenue in the range of $1.57-1.61 billion for the quarter ending June, weaker than analysts estimates, triggering concerns about its ability to regain flagging revenue growth momentum.When TK took over, he was to drive them towards a more streamlined industry focus, with a focus on large accounts. That was the strategy they put in placenow, first of all that strategy took a long time to implement, Samuel of Everest said.The problem, experts said, is that of timing and executing it well enough. You have to ask two questionsis this the right plan? And how are they going about executing it? From an execution standpoint, its mixed. The other problem is everybody else is executing the same strategy, Samuel said.Cognizant and TCS have similar strategies, but look at their performancetheir execution is much better. Wipro has been late to implement these strategies and now theyre facing a lot more headwinds than TCS and Cognizant did when they launched their strategies, he said.Another problem, experts said, was to do with Wipros positioning. Traditionally, Wipro was known for its high-end R&D services and deep technology skills. Customers such as Target Corp. are now looking for deeper engagements and help from companies such as Wipro to solve business problems, Sudin Apte, founder of outsourcing advisory firm Offshore Insights, said. There is a gap between what clients want and what Wipro thinks market wants. Many clients tell Offshore Insights that they (still) find Wipro focused on technology and productivity. While these aspects as well as other Wipro strengths like delivery or quality are important, these factors are now considered by many as table stake, Apte said.Experts such as Phil Fersht, founder of US-based outsourcing advisory firm HfS Research, said the success of rivals TCS and Cognizant in getting business especially from banking customers has hurt Wipros fortunes.To be sure, Wipro was ahead of Infosys Ltd in at least discovering its problems.Its clear Wipro has been experiencing its come to Jesus earlier that its prime competitors, namely Infosys, TCS and Cognizant. This is a blessing in disguise as all the Indian-centric providers with over-dependency on European and US clients for their growth are going to suffer (and some already are), Fersht said. Some experts added that turnarounds take longer, and Wipro may be positioned for better times ahead.Already, Wipros number of customers giving $100 million or more in annual revenue has improved multifold since Kurien took over. From just one such customer in February 2011, Wipro now has nine clients giving $100 million in annual business.Wipro is trying to bring fundamental changes to its portfolio for long-term stability of revenues and to deliver consistent high growth. It is taking slightly longer to deliver quarterly growth rates, but these are changes in the right direction, George and Sharma of JP Morgan said.On his part, Kurien has poached some of the top executives from rival firms and even customer organizations to infuse some fresh approach. In June, Wipro hired former Lloyds Banking Group executive Ganesh Balasubramanian to create a new unit focused on banking products and platforms. Former Infosys leader Shaji Farooq and Satish Doraiswamy of TCS are among people Wipro poached in the past one year.In another organization change this month, Wipro created a group led by company veteran A. Amarnath to focus on getting large outsourcing contracts. Amarnath will report to Kurien. Wipro confirms that it has set up a Deal Advisory and Large Deal Pursuit Management group called the Strategic Mega-Deals Team, a Wipro spokesperson said. Clearly, its taking longer for Wipro to regain its lost momentum and catch up with rivals. Until it shows visible signs of a turnaround, its going to be a slow burn.And investors and experts would be looking for any early signs of the turnaround when Wipro and its rivals announce their April to June quarter earnings later this month.Sometimes, it gets frustrating when youre following the new vision and putting all efforts, and yet, theres nothing to showcase to the world, the second person, familiar with the discussions that took place in the meeting with Joshi in the US last month, said. Hopefully, that will change this year.Catch all the Corporate news and Updates on Live Mint.

Hopefully, that will change this year. Bangalore: Last month, top leaders of Wipro Ltd, led by chief executive T.K. Kurien and head of strategy Rishad Premji, spent two days in San Diego, US, with former head of Hewlett-Packard Co.s (HP) printing business Vyomesh Joshi, who was appointed as an independent director on the companys board last year. add_main_imageUsually, strategy discussions at Wipro happen at three levels every year, the first one where different business units present annual plans to the CEO, the second one where Kurien presents a strategy plan to the companys billionaire founder Azim Premji and thirdly, the final plan vetted by all is presented to the board around January. Meeting with Joshi, who joined HP as a young researcher in its printing division and built the companys $25 billion printing business, was not one of the usual series of strategy discussions at Wipro that take place in a normal year.NextMAds The agenda was to listen to Joshi and understand what strategic bets to prioritize and how, said one of the people familiar with the discussions that took place in the meeting. The person requested anonymity because the details are confidential. The company, however, still continued to lag rivals in overall growth and barring energy and utility business segment, it failed to become a leader in the fast-growing banking and financial services and manufacturing sectors. In the last seven quarters, for instance, Wipros revenue from manufacturing and hi-tech customers grew by only 7.1%, compared to more than 24% revenue growth by rivals from such clients during the same period. For years, Wipro has had the size of a tier-1 (company), but they behaved like a tier-2. And honestly, that continues today, said Peter Bendor Samuel, founder and CEO of Everest Group that advises outsourcing customers on buying services. The difference in performance is quite stark. In calendar year 2012, manufacturing vertical revenues increased merely 5% for Wipro compared to 13% for Infosys, 20% for TCS (Tata Consultancy Services Ltd)and 25%+ for Cognizant, said Viju George and Amit Sharma of JP Morgan Asia Pacific Equity Research in March this year.sixthMAds The report added that its the mix of business within the manufacturing and hi-tech vertical thats causing the problem. Product engineering revenues are also (almost) stagnant at $119 million (in the third quarter of fiscal year 2013) compared to $115 million in 4QFY11, the JP Morgan analysts said. In April, this year, Wipro forecast revenue in the range of $1.57-1.61 billion for the quarter ending June, weaker than analysts estimates, triggering concerns about its ability to regain flagging revenue growth momentum.

File | Photo Credit: Reuters The conglomerate Larsen & Toubro (L&T) said it is betting on aerospace as a potential growth engine, including launch vehicle and satellite manufacturing, as the country cuts reliance on imports and boosts private participation.L&T, considered a bellwether for India's infrastructure spending because of how many industries its work touches, is the country's largest private-sector defense manufacturer by revenue; its Precision Engineering and Systems unit posted revenue of 46.10 billion rupees ($548.3 million) in the 2024 fiscal year, up 41% from the previous year.At its factory in Coimbatore, in Tamil Nadu, L&T is assembling the country's first privately built Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV), a mainstay of ISRO's launch programme, through a consortium with Hindustan Aeronautics Limited.

India's space sector is valued at $13 billion, according to a February report by research firm DAM Capital.L&T's plans intersect with India's strategy to position the country as a leading space power, with Prime Minister Modi's government pushing for the industry to become a force for further economic growth.The country hopes liberalized regulations allowing private firms to design, build and operate launch services will attract global players, mirroring the commercial space boom seen in the United States and Europe.The first launch of a privately built PSLV booster, delayed from early 2025, is expected to occur by mid-year, though an exact date had not yet been decided, Ramchandani said. Each rocket costs about $30 million.""Clearly when we are getting into a business like this, it is with an eye to the global market,"" Ramchandani said.

(Reuters)A surge in international business, particularly from the Middle East, helped Indias largest engineering and infrastructure company Larsen & Toubro (L&T) grow its order book at a compounded annual rate of over 15% between FY21 and FY25, even as growth in domestic orders chugged along at a slower pace.The company believes that growth in international business will once again outpace domestic business expansion in FY26.

We think the momentum will continue, said R. Shankar Raman, president, whole-time director and CFO of L&T.We do think FY26 will also have certain tilt towards international orders, he said during a post-earnings media call on Thursday.Shankar Raman said that L&T was not worried about the Indian governments change in stance to focus on a consumption-led growth over infrastructure investment-led growth in the economy.We do believe that investments lead to employment generation, which leads to income generation and hence consumption. We continue to bet on the need for the government to step up on its infrastructure investment. We still think we are under-invested (in infrastructure), he said.In its latest budget, the Union government increased the income threshold for zero tax liability and rationalized the direct tax slabs to spur consumption.

The company believes that growth in international business will once again outpace domestic business expansion in FY26. L&T usually wins 20-25% of the contracts it bids for. ""There is a massive international opportunity that the company is capitalising on. ""There are some risks like headwinds in the IT and technology services business and high concentration of business in the Middle East which need to be priced in, but overall I am more positive on the stock than before given the management outlook of FY26.""

I think there is a momentum in the international market at the moment. Shankar Raman, president, whole-time director and CFO of L&T. We do think FY26 will also have certain tilt towards international orders, he said during a post-earnings media call on Thursday. Shankar Raman said that L&T was not worried about the Indian governments change in stance to focus on a consumption-led growth over infrastructure investment-led growth in the economy. We do believe that investments lead to employment generation, which leads to income generation and hence consumption. We still think we are under-invested (in infrastructure), he said. In its latest budget, the Union government increased the income threshold for zero tax liability and rationalized the direct tax slabs to spur consumption.

The relaxation in final norms for gold loans and liquidity coverage ratio (LCR), along with the deferment of Expected Credit Loss (ECL) implementation, signal a clear intent to revive credit growth.Additionally, recent aggressive rate actionsincluding a 50-basis point cut in the repo rate and a 100-basis point reduction in the cash reserve ratio (CRR) during the June 2025 MPC meetingunderscore the central banks commitment.Despite these efforts, credit growth remains subdued at 9.0% year-on-year as of end-May 2025, marking the lowest level since March 2022 and reflecting a modest 0.2% growth year-to-date compared to 2.1% during the same period last year.Also Read | SBI picks five banks to manage its 25,000 crore fundraiseBank Nifty poised for further upside, says Bajaj BrokingBajaj Broking said the Bank Nifty is likely to scale up to the 57,600 mark in the coming weeks.

Nifty Bank in focus today: Indian banking stocks extended their winning streak for the third consecutive session on Thursday, June 26, supported by favourable global cues following the Israel-Iran truce, which has improved risk-on sentiment toward the Indian stock market. This, combined with expectations of a potential rebound in credit growth driven by the central banks recent liquidity measures, has made banking stocks increasingly attractive to investors.

The sustained demand for banking stocks on Dalal Street is also likely to help the index close June in the green, marking its fourth consecutive monthly gain  a streak last seen in March 2016. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) last week relaxed project finance regulations to make lending more affordable for infrastructure and industrial projects. While the draft guidelines had proposed sharply higher provisioning requirements of up to 5% during the construction phase, the final norms are significantly more lenient. Also Read | HDFC Bank share price hits record high. Is HDB Financial IPO the reason? Provisioning has been set at 1.25% for commercial real estate and 1.00% for residential and other exposures during construction, with existing lower rates retained once projects become operational. These measures are part of a broader set of easing steps taken by the RBI over recent months. The relaxation in final norms for gold loans and liquidity coverage ratio (LCR), along with the deferment of Expected Credit Loss (ECL) implementation, signal a clear intent to revive credit growth. Additionally, recent aggressive rate actionsincluding a 50-basis point cut in the repo rate and a 100-basis point reduction in the cash reserve ratio (CRR) during the June 2025 MPC meetingunderscore the central banks commitment. Despite these efforts, credit growth remains subdued at 9.0% year-on-year as of end-May 2025, marking the lowest level since March 2022 and reflecting a modest 0.2% growth year-to-date compared to 2.1% during the same period last year.

,Urban markets will continue to drive overall FMCG growth: CFO | Interview,https://www.cnbctv18.com/business/companies/hindustan-unilever-hul-cfo-on-price-cuts-margin-acquisitions-16849421.htm?utm_source=chatgpt.com,"Urban markets will continue to drive overall FMCG growth: CFO | InterviewVolume-led growth to return for HUL from second half of FY23, that's the word coming in from Hindustan Unilevers CFO Ritesh Tiwari. Here are edited excerpts from an interview.By Shilpa Ranipeta June 5, 2023, 5:07:21 PM IST (Updated)10 Min ReadIndias largest fast-moving consumer goods player Hindustan Unilever (HUL) has said its consumers will see prices of soaps, detergents, and shampoos coming down over the next few weeks. Here are edited excerpts from HUL Chief Financial Officer Ritesh Tiwari's exclusive interview with CNBC-TV18. Q: With inflation cooling off, we have seen some grammage increases in price cuts that have been taken. Is it safe to say that price increases are behind us? And will we see more benefits of inflation and the commodity prices cooling off being passed on to consumers? A: At an aggregate level, the answer is an absolute yes. Q: So largely skin cleansing categories saw price cuts and grammage being increased. Will other categories follow soon? A: Let me give some examples. We saw the highest amount of inflation impact in the skin cleansing, soap business, laundry business and hair care. Now there's a meaningful correction which has happened, so we have taken price cuts. In many places, we have done volume increase by either giving a soap free with a bundle of soap or adding more grammage to an existing soap or for that matter adding more powder to a pouch of laundry. In terms of hair, we have decreased the net price a consumer pays for buying a shampoo bottle. There are very few elements of the portfolio where we have done price increases. That is limited I would say to a portfolio called HFD or health food drinks where milk prices, cereal barley those materials, soft commodities, as they call them, agri materials, we have seen prices of those commodities going up and, hence, we have taken price increases. But at an aggregate level, overall, we do see the price growth impact is coming off. Q: How are the trends for pack sizes? A: In the entire period of high inflation, we did not see downgrading, apart from tea. Typically, consumers continued to buy the brands that they love to consume. But they either traded up or traded down for value. When it came to price point packs, consumers traded down to smaller pack sizes to combat the impact of inflation. But when they saw good value in larger pack sizes, for example, laundry, they bought bigger pack sizes. As we are seeing inflation coming off, I do expect a correction to happen of going back to their comfortable pack sizes. Q: Do you think that urban will continue to do better than rural and drive growth? A: I believe that urban will have a higher contribution to overall FMCG growth. Two-thirds of the Indian population lives in rural areas, and one-third lives in urban areas but the consumption of FMCG is the other way around -- two-thirds of the consumption is from urban areas and one-third from rural areas. Within Hindustan Unilever as well, our premium portfolio sold well ahead of the rest of the portfolio. Hence, I do believe that next few quarters going ahead, urban will continue to be driving the overall FMCG growth. Q: What is the margin expansion outlook also looking like? A: There are different kinds of margins which are relevant to focus on depending upon the economic cycle and commodity cycle that we are in. At this point in time, the most important element is gross margin, which is sales minus the cost of making materials and products. In the last two-three years, we have dropped 600 basis points (bps) of our gross margin. This was because cumulatively over the last two years, there was 30 percent inflation in commodity cost and against that we took an 18 percent price rise. So, the 12 percent price versus cost gap had a tell on our gross margin. The good news is with a good job done continuously in the business on savings, driving savings across all the lines of the P&L and commodities coming off in the last quarter that we declared results, our gross margin, which had taken us 600 bps hurt, has improved in last two quarters by 300 bps. So almost half of the total margin decline has come back. Further job, of course, needs to be done. If I look at the last few quarters more than 23 percentage, we do believe it's a very healthy margin. And at this point in time, the focus will be volume growth, gross margin, maintaining a competitive price value equation, and investing in advertising sales promotion. Q: Do you think that the ice cream sales will be impacted this summer season? A: We are still in the middle of the summer. In any which case, the per capita consumption of ice cream is very low. So, there is headroom for us to grow. More importantly, we are working on ice cream to see how can we de-seasonalise this category. Given the temperature variation in the bulk of the country, there is no reason why ice cream should only be consumed during the summer period. Will it (consumption pattern) change overnight? The answer is no. But we want to build an innovation cycle for the ice cream business, which lasts far beyond the seasonal impact only. We have seen good success and you saw our quarterly results last year, not only in season, we had good growth, but also outside the peak ice cream season in the June quarter that we ended up seeing because of summer, we also had fabulous growth outside that season as well and that effort will continue. So, ice cream, going forward, will not be only a seasonal June quarter story. Q: Personal care is one category that, on an industry level, has been a laggard the entire year. But that's not been the case for HUL. Has the premium portfolio within personal care been driving growth? How have you outpaced the overall market trend for personal care? A: This market will start fragmenting which is why what we have done is segmented our own skincare portfolio into different demand spaces - skin lighting, number one; number two is glow, number three, the entire space of moisturizers. So, we have ensured that our portfolio is segmented into many more different demand spaces. And in each of the demand spaces today, we are market leaders. We did see an impact overall for the industry during the pandemic and during the high inflation period. When the discretionary category saw an impact mass skincare saw a higher impact compared to premium skincare. Now the good news is that as we are seeing inflation coming off overall, it should start helping the recovery of discretionary categories like skincare. But our story has been a story of growing formats, a story of growing more brand presence. We launched five brands in the last year and a half in that space. Some of them are DTC brands, some brands have also gone offline. Read Here | Hindustan Unilever has started slashing prices of soaps and detergents as costs cool off, says CFO Q: The homecare category has been performing well, what have been the drivers behind that growth? A: As I mentioned earlier, during the period of high inflation, we have seen that the premium portfolio has been more resilient. And we have that tailwind in our home care portfolio, which has a higher contribution from premiums. And the tailwind helped us to outpace the market significantly last year. Q: And now do you see the mass part also growing because you spoke about passing on the benefits of the lower commodity prices... A: There are 2-3 dimensions out here. The headline growth that we had for home care was driven by price. The price growth component for homecare will keep reducing, and total growth will be lower compared to what we had last year. Will we keep growing, but the scale of outpace will be different compared to what we had last year. This was also the period when trusted brands got a larger share of the business. As commodities overall have started to come off, we will see more players coming into the market. Now in terms of pricing actions, you do pricing actions across the portfolio, when commodities come off, you take the price off of the premium portfolio, you take the price off of a popular portfolio, and you also take the price off of the mass portfolio and the reason you do that because the overall price gap and the price difference between different brands and different price points that should not become larger. So, hence pricing actions happen across every part of the portfolio. Q: Can we expect more price cuts going forward? A: Large categories like laundry, and skin cleansing; commodities have, in the last couple of quarters significantly come off and we have started passing the benefit meaningfully to consumers. Of course, at any point in time, the key element for us is maintaining a competitive price value equation. There is always a little further job to be done but also depends upon how commodities will further incrementally play off in the next few quarters. But whatever price cuts we have done, there is always a trade pipeline, and for that matter consumer pantry pipeline. And by the time consumers start experiencing the lower price of products, it takes a few months. Q: Going forward are you looking at more M&As? A: One must be very mindful that you only acquire when you can create more value compared to what owners have been doing. And we have been very mindful of our own potential to create value before deciding to acquire or buy something. So, in that way, we have a very measured approach in that space. So, I would say the approach is always to look at the demand space and then see what portfolio we can use and play with to ensure we create a fabulous business in that demand space. Q: So, the demand space that you are looking at right now, is the health and wellbeing and the other one is the masstige category of the beauty. Q: Not only DTC brands, but larger companies like Reliance have entered the FMCG. Do you think this has or will trigger a price war? A: There is enough room for multiple players to coexist and create value  that is one reality of the FMCG market, which is why in India FMCG is not a zero-sum game. If you look at India, almost every global multinational is in the country, there are fabulously large Indian businesses that operate in FMCG extremely successfully, there are a great number of local and regional brands that have fabulous products, and there are equally new-age DTC brands. If I look at price points, almost every brand, and every category has different price points. From here onwards, the way I see the intensity will continue but there is huge value to be created. Now, one of the points I keep talking about is that, yes, we do focus on competition, but our obsession is with consumers. What can we do with our consumers to ensure that we bring best-in-class products. Coming to Reliance, we have a fabulous relationship with Reliance. They are our suppliers of key ingredients, and they are also our customers, we have a fabulous relationship with them. Competition has always got the best out of Hindustan Unilever.

Tata motors,Neutral Tata Motors; target of Rs 690: Motilal Oswal,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/neutral-tata-motors-target-of-rs-690-motilal-oswal-2-13130950.html,"We attended Tata Motors’ (TTMT) virtual analyst meet for its JLR business. JLR continues to face several headwinds, such as tariff wars and resultant USD depreciation vs. GBP, uncertainty over EV transition, challenging market conditions in China, and rising warranty costs. As a result, management has lowered its EBIT margin guidance for FY26 to 5-7% from 10% earlier. It has also reduced its FCF guidance to nil from GBP1.8b earlier. TTMT has also indicated that it is working hard to improve efficiencies across the firm, with specific enterprise missions to drive the firm’s transformation amid headwinds. These initiatives could result in cost savings of GBP1.4b p.a. during 2HFY26 to FY27-28 and help TTMT to return to its earlier EBIT margin target of 10% over time. While our estimates were already lower than the consensus, we have reduced our FY26 EBIT margin assumption for JLR to 6% (earlier 6.9%), which has led to a 10% cut in our FY26 earnings estimates. We have maintained our FY27 estimates at this stage. Given the multiple headwinds highlighted above, we reiterate Neutral with FY27E SOTP-based TP of INR690.

Tata motors,Tata Motors targets market share and margin growth in 2027 amid trade turmoil,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/tata-motors-targets-market-share-and-margin-growth-in-2027-amid-trade-turmoil-13104964.html,"Leading carmaker Tata Motors targets scaling up its double-digit EBITDA for the CV business into teens by FY26 and is aiming at a 10 percent EBITDA for PV and EV business by FY30, an investor presentation said on June 9. The CV business will be 'stepping up the pace now', said Tata Motors, setting sight on 40% market share by 2027, with teen EBITDA margin. Commercial vehicles at Tata Motors could see a proactive investment in decarbonisation and connectivity solutions, along with software defined vehicles (SDVs). The management reaffirmed its EV business achieved EBITDA breakeven in FY25 in a mark of improved profitability, which it said will continue going forward. The car maker is now targetting its EV business to have a penetration of 20% By FY27 and over 30% by FY30 with continued improvement in margins. The EV side of the business is well-funded for the next three years, added Tata Motors, and said it is aiming at leading the transition towards software defined vehicles (SDV) in India. Tata Motors added that it plans to 'converge' its cost structure for EVs with ICE engine and deliver positive EBITDA. Tata Motors - leader in the electric space - has been losing market share over the past one year on increasing competitive intensity, which knocked down the EV market share to 35% in May 2025 as against 66% a year ago. New lauches by Mahindra and Hyundai Motor have helped rivals bridge the gap, along with a JSW-MG Motors’ Windsor, which took the company's market share to 31% in May 2025 from 19% a year ago. Tata Motors is now pinning hopes of recently launched Harrier EV to regain market share. On car sales, the management sees muted demand growth going forward, with the shift to SUVs continuing, amid a highly competitive environment. Tata Motors added that the uncertainty around the global trade environment may continue to induce added volatility into the business. Tata Motors said it will double-digit EBITDA margins and positive free cashflow in the passenger vehicle segment, going forward. Tata Motors cited a moderation in demand as having impacted its profitability in FY25, along with rising competition in the SUV segment, and an inflationary trend in commodities and currencies. For this fiscal, the management continues to see muted demand growth and inventory with dealers could stay high. In order to survive the competitive intensity, Tata Motors said it will continue to rely on its SUV portfolio, with a planned launch of Tata Sierra in H2FY26. However, global trade uncertainties could results in continued volatility in FY26, it added. Read More: Tata Motors pins hope on new EVs, stronger demand to lead FY26 comeback The management added that its aftersales transformation initiatives have resulted in significant improvement, with a 21 percent improvement in same-day service metric, and a 25 percent drop in vehicles needing multiple workshop visits. The FY26 capex has been projected to be in-line with what the company spent during FY25. The management has assigned July 1, 2025 as the date for the demerger of CV business and amalgamation of TMPVL into Tata Motors. Between September and December this year, the car company is hoping for the final NCLT approval for the demerger, which will see the existing listed company to trade ex-CV business, and Tata Motors will be renamed as TMPVL, and the new CV company will be separately listed subsequently. Shareholders and analysts will next be watching for the FY26 guidance and updates at the JLR Investor Day on June 16, 2025.

Tata motors,"Tata Motors shares rise 3% as Trump likely to announce trade deal with UK
",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/tata-motors-shares-rise-nearly-3-as-trump-likely-to-announce-trade-deal-with-uk-13016848.html,"Shares of Tata Motors rose up to 3% on May 8 as the New York Times reported, citing three people familiar with the plans, that US President Donald Trump is expected to announce a trade deal between the United States and Britain. Trump posted on Truth Social earlier that he would hold an Oval Office news conference at 10 a.m. EDT (1400 GMT) on Thursday about a ""major trade deal with representatives of a big, and highly respected, country,"" using all capitalized letters. He did not offer more details but said it would be the ""first of many."" A UK official said on Tuesday that the two countries had made good progress on a trade deal that would likely include lower tariff quotas on steel and autos. Britain was not among the countries hit with additional tariffs, because it imports more from the U.S. than it exports there. At 9:37 am on May 8, shares of Tata Motors, the parent company of luxury car maker Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), were trading 2.4% higher at Rs 697 apiece before hitting day's high of Rs 704.5. If the deal with the UK gets announced, it could be a major positive for Jaguar Land Rover, as nearly one-fifth of its revenue comes from the US market. The company had halted shipments of its vehicles in April owing to the US imposing 25% tariffs on all auto imports. However, recent reports have suggested that shipments have resumed but there has been no official confirmation. The Tata Motors stock rose on May 7 as well after the announcement of the India-UK Free Trade Agreement (FTA), signed on Tuesday evening. This agreement includes provisions for a significant reduction in import tariffs on premium cars destined for India. Tariffs, previously exceeding 100%, are set to drop to 10% under a quota system. Also, Tata Motors said on Tuesday its shareholders have approved the company's plan to split the automaker into two listed companies, separating its passenger and commercial vehicle arms. Tata Motors had said last March that it would divide its commercial vehicle arm from its passenger business, which houses its cash cow luxury Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) brand, to unlock better growth prospects. The proposal, which would give the shareholders equal stakes in both the listed entities, was approved with 99.9995% of votes, it said in an exchange filing.

Tata motors,Tata Motors likely resumes JLR export to the US after Trump's auto tariff relief,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/tata-motors-likely-resumes-jlr-export-to-the-us-after-trump-s-auto-tariff-relief-13012646.html,"Tata Motors’ stocks were higher about 1.50 percent on May 5 after reports said Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), its luxury car brand has started shipping cars to the US again. News agency Reuters, quoting the London Times, reported that Tata Motor's luxury car brand JLR has sent its first batch of vehicles on April 30, after almost a month-long pause. JLR had stopped shipments in early April due to the 25% tariff on car imports put in place by that US President Trump on April 2. Tata Motors’ shares are higher by up to 1% on May 5, and higher by 12.5 percent over last one month. JLR has not officially commented on resuming the shipments, but the development is significant as US is the second-biggest market for UK-made JLR cars after the European Union, making up nearly 20 percent of its exports. Read More A JLR spokesperson told Reuters that the US remains a key market for its luxury cars, even with 25% auto tariffs still in effect. ""As we work to address the new US trading terms with our business partners, we are enacting our planned short-term actions, as we develop our mid- to long-term plans. We will give a further update at our full year results in May,"" the statement added. President Trump had eased tariffs on auto parts with credits and other relief measures, though carmakers still say these are not enough to calm worries. Aston Martin, another UK carmaker, said it’ll split the tariff costs with customers, sell off its US inventory, and limit new shipments to the US for now. Tata Motors’ sales in the domestic & international market for Q4FY25 was about 2.53 lakh units, compared to 2.65 lakh units a year ago.

Tata motors,Tata Motors shares sink 5% as Jaguar Land Rover pauses shipments to US amid heavy auto tariffs,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/tata-motors-shares-sink-9-as-jaguar-land-rover-pauses-shipments-to-us-amid-heavy-auto-tariffs-12986592.html,"Auto major Tata Motors Ltd.'s shares were the worst performers on the Nifty 50 index in trade on April 7, after the auto player announced its key subsidiary Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) would pause shipments to the U.S. in April in the wake of President Trump’s tariffs. At close, shares of Tata Motors were quoting Rs 581.1 on the NSE, down 5.3 percent compared to the previous session's closing price. The UK-based auto player stated that exports to U.S. will be halted, as the firm assess strategies for figuring out the 25 percent tariff on imported cars. Given the tariffs, international brokerage CLSA cut its rating on Tata Motors shares on April 4 to 'outperform', down from 'high-conviction outperform' earlier. The target price on Tata Group player was cut to Rs 765 per share, down from Rs 930 apiece earlier. The downgrade comes amid concerns over 25 percent U.S. tariffs on all auto imports, which could lead to a 14 percent year-on-year drop in JLR volumes by FY26. Tata Motors is expected to see a significant hit from the tariffs, as subsidiary Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has deep exposure to the American market. JLR sold over 4 lakh units globally in FY24, of which about 23 percent were sold in US alone. CLSA expects JLR’s EBIT margin to fall to 7 percent in FY26/27, down from 9 percent in FY25. While JLR’s FY26 EBITDA estimate has been cut by 15 percent, free cash flow is expected to remain positive. ""The US alone contributed over a fifth of JLR's total revenue last year, making it a crucial market. With limited options to maintain margins and meet prior guidance, JLR will likely resort to price hikes and cost efficiencies. However, these strategies won’t yield immediate results, and a near-term hit to both revenue and profitability is expected,"" said Nirav Karkera, Head of Research at Fisdom. Tata Motors shares have been under pressure over the past year, eroding 40 percent in value. In comparison, the Nifty 50 index has gained around one percent during the same time period.

JPMorgan has maintained its price target at ₹5,000, implying a potential upside of just 1% from the stock’s last closing level on Friday. The foreign brokerage said in its note that it sees limited near-term catalysts following the stock’s 33% rally over the past three months, compared to a 10% rise in the Nifty. The brokerage mentioned that while equity inflows have remained strong over the past few years, supported by benign inflation, consistent GDP growth, and accommodative monetary policy, they have started to slow year-to-date. However, Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) flows remain resilient, which JPMorgan sees as a medium-term driver of the stock’s investment case. These positive factors seem to be fairly reflected in the fiscal year 2026 and 2027 price-to-earnings ratios of 37 times and 33 times. Out of the 27 analysts that have coverage on HDFC Asset Management Company, 20 of them have continue to have a 'Buy' rating on the stock, six have a 'Hold' rating, while one has a 'Sell' rating.

HDFC,"HDFC Bank Shares Rise as HDB Financial Services’ ₹12,500 Crore IPO Opens for Subscription
",https://groww.in/blog/hdfc-bank-shares-rise-as-hdb-financial-services-12500-crore-ipo-opens-for-subscription,"HDFC Bank’s share price edged higher on June 25, 2025, climbing 0.4% to ₹1,968.80 on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) in early trade, as its subsidiary HDB Financial Services launched a blockbuster initial public offering (IPO) valued at ₹12,500 crore. The IPO, which will remain open until June 27, comprises a fresh issue of ₹2,500 crore and an offer for sale (OFS) of ₹10,000 crore by HDFC Bank, the promoter and majority shareholder. As of 12:48 PM, the bank’s share price is trading at ₹1,977.00, gaining 0.82%. HDFC Bank currently holds a 94.36% stake in HDB Financial Services, a non-banking financial company (NBFC) with a diversified lending portfolio and a pan-India presence. The IPO price band is set between ₹700 and ₹740 per share, with an application size of 20 shares. At the upper end of the price band, HDB Financial is valued at ₹61,400 crore. Ahead of the IPO, HDB Financial Services mobilised ₹3,369 crore from a robust line-up of anchor investors, including leading domestic and global names such as ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund, SBI Mutual Fund, Nippon India Mutual Fund, Life Insurance Corporation of India, BlackRock, Allianz Global Investors, Morgan Stanley, Royal Bank of Canada, Prudential plc, Copthall Mauritius Investment, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance, APG Asset Management, Norway’s Government Pension Fund Global, Goldman Sachs, Baillie Gifford, Schroder, Fidelity Investments, Societe Generale, Tata Investment Corporation, and Abu Dhabi Investment Authority. This strong anchor book underscores institutional confidence in HDB Financial’s business model and growth prospects, further buoying sentiment around HDFC Bank shares. HDB Financial Services reported a net profit of ₹2,176 crore for the financial year ending March 2025, up sharply from ₹1,359 crore a year earlier. The company maintains healthy asset quality, with gross non-performing assets (GNPA) at 2.49% and net NPA at 1.38%. Its business spans secured and unsecured personal loans, gold loans, and lending to small and medium enterprises (SMEs), supported by over 1,700 branches across 1,200 cities and a customer base exceeding 1.9 crore. The IPO proceeds from the fresh issue will be used to strengthen HDB Financial’s Tier-I capital base, supporting future business growth and lending activities. The OFS component will allow HDFC Bank to pare down its stake, aligning with regulatory norms and unlocking value for shareholders. Brokerage houses have largely endorsed the IPO, citing HDB Financial’s strong parentage, established brand, robust governance, and sound risk management practices. SBI Securities, Anand Rathi, and Centrum have issued ‘subscribe’ recommendations, highlighting the company’s well-diversified product portfolio, granular retail lending model, and access to low-cost funding backed by a AAA-rated credit profile. At the upper end of the price band, the IPO values HDB Financial at a price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 3.7x for FY25, which is considered reasonable compared to larger peers such as Bajaj Finance and Cholamandalam Investment and Finance. Deven Choksey Research notes that the IPO is attractively priced, with a trailing twelve-month P/B of 3.4x versus the peer average of 4.4x. The grey market premium (GMP) for the HDB Financial IPO stands at approximately ₹74 per share, suggesting a potential listing gain of around 10%. This positive sentiment has translated into early gains for HDFC Bank shares, as investors anticipate a successful listing and value unlocking for the parent company.

The opening of HDB Financial Services’ ₹12,500 crore IPO has provided a fresh impetus to HDFC Bank’s stock, reflecting investor optimism around the subsidiary’s growth prospects and the parent bank’s value creation. With strong institutional backing, robust fundamentals, and reasonable valuations, the IPO is poised to be one of the largest and most closely watched offerings of the year.

NBFCs have shown remarkable resilience and gained importance in the financial sector ecosystem, growing from less than Rs 2 trillion AUM at the turn of the century to Rs 48 trillion at the end of FY25. NBFCs AUM as of FY19 was approximately Rs 23 trillion which grew at a 6-year CAGR of 13.2% to Rs 48 trillion as of FY25. Rapid revival in the economy is expected to drive consumer demand on FY26, leading to healthy growth in NBFCs. The NBFC credit is expected to grow at 15-17% between FY 25 and FY 28, driven by growth across retail, MSME and corporate segments continuing to be the primary drivers. HDB Financial Services Limited being one of the leading and the fastest growing NBFC is well-positioned to capitalize on the growth opportunities within the sector and the company aims to diversify and expand addressable customer segments by widening and enhancing product offering and continue to expand pan-India omni-channel distribution network. Investors looking to invest can invest in the IPO for the long term.- Master Capital Services Ltd 15:42 | June 25, 2025HDB Financial Services IPO Live: SMIFS Ltd says HDB is expected to outperform the sector With scalable operations, granular customer acquisition, diversified funding, and expanding fee-based revenues, HDB is expected to sustain its growth momentum, outperform the sector, and continue delivering healthy, sustainable returns. We recommend to subscribe to the issue as a good long term investment as the company aligns with the aggressive mindset of the parent and improvement in npa levels that have seen recent deterioration while the CAR levels post issue are adequate for the next 12-18 months.SMIFS 15:39 | June 25, 2025Stock market live updates today: Sensex, Nifty 50 end higher; IT & media stocks shine Sensex ended 700.40 pts or 0.85% higher at 82,755.51 and Nifty 50 settled at 25,244.75, up by 200.40 pts or 0.8%.15:37 | June 25, 2025HDB Financial Services IPO Live: Deven Choksey Research expects HDBFSL’s AUM and disbursements to grow We expect that its AUM and disbursement will witness higher growth compared to FY25, led by higher urban and rural consumer demand driven by government’s intervention in reducing income tax rates, RBI’s efficient inflation management and expected cuts in GST rates for the overall consumption basket. HDB’s initial issue is priced at 3.4x TTM P/B (considered equity raise for calculating TTM BV) compared to the peer average of 4.4x TTM P/B. We believe the issue is attractively priced considering its parentage, peer group ROA average and its growth potential. We assign a “SUBSCRIBE” rating to the initial issue of the HDB Financial Services.- Deven Choksey Research 15:28 | June 25, 2025HDB Financial Services IPO Live: Canara Bank Securities emphasised HDB’s strong brand, despite valuation concerns. Some key concerns follow Key risks, according to Canara Bank Securities, include a high cost-to-income ratio (42%) and 27% unsecured loan exposure, though mitigated by data-driven underwriting. Despite valuation concerns, HDB’s strong brand, stable financials, rural reach, and niche positioning offer long-term potential for medium-to-long-term investor 15:19 | June 25, 2025HDB Financial Services IPO Live: BP WEALTH RECOMMENDS SUBSCRIBING TO THE ISSUE HDBFSL has reported a steady topline CAGR of 14.6% between FY23 and FY25. On the return front, HBDFSL has reported ROA at 2.1% in FY25 (vs 2.7% in FY24), while ROE declined from 17.9% in FY24 to 14.6% in FY25. GNPA and NNPA both increased from 1.9% and 0.6% in FY24 to 2.3% and 1.0% in FY25, respectively, as a result of slippages and write-offs during the fiscal. Despite the relatively lower return ratios and profitability growth, we remain optimistic of the company’s longer -term growth trend supported by a strong brand parentage, diversified liability franchise supported by a strong credit rating of AAA and a pan-India presence. The issue is valued at a P/B ratio of 3.9x at the upper price band based on FY25 book value, which we believe to be fairly valued compared to its peers. Considering the above compelling factors, we recommend a “SUBSCRIBE” rating to this issue from a long term perspective.- BP WEALTH 15:09 | June 25, 2025HDB Financial Limited IPO Live: Subscribed 0.28 times HDB Financial Limited has been subscribed 0.28 times as at 3.03 pm on June 25, 2025.

This places it above peers like L&amp;T Finance and Mahindra Finance, and in line with Sundaram Finance and Cholamandalam, but below the premium commanded by Bajaj Finance.- Gaurav Garg, Lemonn Markets Desk14:09 | June 25, 2025HDB Financial Services IPO Live: SBI Securities’ lists 5 risk factors • Further stake sale by parent HDFC Bank can be overhang on the stock price: The parent HDFC Bank may have to decrease its holding from 74.2% (post-issue @ UB) to less than 20% in a span of 2 years, according to the draft circular by the RBI, which was issued on 4th October 24. • Asset quality risk: The company’s Gross Stage 3 Loans accounted for 2.3% of the gross loans as of Mar’25, which may adversely affect the company’s financials in case of non-payment or default. • Unsecured loan risk: Unsecured loans accounted for 27.0% of the company’s gross loans as of Mar’25. • Liquidity risk: Any asset-liability mismatch may cause liquidity concerns affecting the results of operations and financial condition• Regulatory risk: The NBFC industry is highly regulated by the Reserve Bank of India, and any adverse regulations or any failure to comply with a regulation may have an adverse impact on the business. - SBI Securities13:39 | June 25, 2025Stock market live updates: Mid-market | IT stocks led gains, defence majors in red All IT stocks traded in green, led by Mphasis, LTIMindtree, Infosys.

We think as it is backed by the brand strength and operational discipline of its promoter, HDFC Bank, HDB has demonstrated consistent growth, strong underwriting capabilities, and resilient asset quality— evidenced by its low GNPA and NNPA ratios. We also think with over 19 million customers, a granular loan book, and a robust phygital distribution network of 1,771 branches and 140,000+ retail touchpoints, the company is well positioned to capture underpenetrated credit demand, particularly among “new to credit” borrowers. By looking at the financials, the company has demonstrated a a revenue growth of 14.3% in FY2024 and 15% in FY2025, with net profit rising by 25.6% in FY2024, though witnessing a modest decline of 11.6% in FY2025, mainly on account of two- fold increase in provision. On valuation parse at the upper price band of ₹740/-, the issue is asking a market cap of ₹ 61,388 cr. Based on FY 2025 earnings and fully diluted post-IPO paid up capital, the company is asking for Price to book ratio (P/B) of 3.5x which seems fairly valued looking at its industry average ~3.5-4x. Given its strong parentage, proven execution across cycles, diversified loan mix, and digital-first approach, we believe HDB Financial Services is well positioned to benefit from India’s ongoing financial inclusion and expanding retail credit demand.Hence, looking at all attributes we recommend investors to “SUBSCRIBE” the HDB Financial Services Ltd IPO for long term perspective.Mehta Equities 12:46 | June 25, 2025HDB Financial Limited IPO Live: Subscribed 0.17 times HDB Financial Limited has been subscribed 0.17 times as at 12.42 pm on June 25, 2025.

HDB’s asset quality is superior to peers on the back of its strong ownership and management pedigree. Its loan growth has been in line with peers over last 3 years. However we note that owing to HDB’s prudent focus on quality of customers, it earns a lower spread vis-à-vis peers. Also HDB’s operational cost is elevated. Thus HDB has managed to deliver ROA in the range of between 2 to 3% over last 3 years with FY25 post IPO ROA of 2.0%. This is below the peer average of 3.2% and Bajaj Finance’s 5.0% witnessed in FY25. Although we believe that HDB should be valued at a substantial discount to Bajaj Finance, its superior parentage and asset quality performance lead us to believe that it is attractively valued from a long term perspective upon comparing with Chola which has ROA of 2.4% and is being valued at 5.5x FY25 compared to HDB’s 3.4x (post IPO). Also HDB’s valuation is in line with the peer average which provides us comfort. Therefore, we recommend SUBSCRIBE to the issue, with a Long-term POSITIVE outlookNirmal Bang12:37 | June 25, 2025HDB Financial Services IPO Live: Tarun Singh, MD and Founder, Highbrow Securities, says the launch timing coincides with a Goldilocks period for NBFCs Timing the Tide: Cyclical Sweet Spot or Regulatory Compulsion?The IPO’s June launch coincides with a Goldilocks period for NBFCs – credit growth remains robust at 15%+, asset quality metrics have normalized post-pandemic, and risk appetite is returning to rural markets. However, beneath these favorable conditions lurk structural challenges: rising cost of funds (HDB’s NIMs compressed 30 bps in FY24), increasing competition from new-age fintechs, and the perennial volatility of unsecured lending (27% of HDB’s portfolio). HDFC Bank’s decision to monetize part of its 94% stake through a ₹10,000 crore OFS while retaining 74% ownership suggests cautious optimism – they’re taking money off the table but maintaining skin in the game. The fresh ₹2,500 crore capital infusion will strengthen HDB’s tier-1 capital adequacy (currently at 16.8%), providing ammunition to chase growth while maintaining healthy buffers. For investors, the key consideration isn’t whether HDB is a good company (its 2.26% GNPA and 23% CAGR loan book growth confirm it is), but whether it can translate its HDFC lineage and pan-India presence into superior returns in a maturing market. In many ways, HDB’s IPO represents the NBFC sector’s transition from its “wild west” days to a more regulated, institutional phase. Its performance post-listing will reveal much about public market appetite for steady, diversified lenders in an environment where specialists often steal the spotlight. The company’s fate won’t just belong to its shareholders, but will serve as a barometer for the entire NBFC sector’s next chapter.- Tarun Singh, MD and Founder, Highbrow Securities, says 12:18 | June 25, 2025HDB Financial IPO Live Today: Not dependent on HDFC Bank for operational purposes, says HDB Financial CEO IPO-bound non-banking finance company (NBFC) HDB Financial Services does not get or give any business leads to HDFC Bank or share any office space with the latter, and is not reliant on its parent for operational purposes, MD & CEO G Ramesh, told businessline in an interaction. “We originate our business ourselves, we don’t get any leads from any of our promoter companies. We underwrite our own business, and operate 1,771 branches of HDB Financial Services. They are our own branches and there is no shared space with HDFC Bank.

First, it underscores the RBI’s push to bring systemically important NBFCs (like HDB, classified in the “upper layer”) under greater market discipline through public listings. Second, it highlights how banks are reluctantly reducing stakes in lucrative NBFC subsidiaries ahead of anticipated ownership caps.Third, and most importantly, the offering serves as a referendum on whether generalist NBFCs can command premium valuations in a market that increasingly rewards niche lenders. - Tarun Singh, MD and Founder, Highbrow Securities, says Stay tuned.

Coming at a time when RBI is pushing large NBFCs toward listing (with a September 2025 deadline), this IPO represents both a regulatory compliance exercise and a strategic coming-of-age for HDFC Bank’s 17-year-old shadow lending arm. The timing is telling: with credit growth outpacing GDP expansion and NBFCs capturing 40% of new retail loans, HDB’s public listing offers a calibrated entry point into India’s formalisation of credit. - Tarun Singh, MD and Founder, Highbrow Securities, saysStay tuned.

NBFCs have shown remarkable resilience and gained importance in the financial sector ecosystem, growing from less than Rs 2 trillion AUM at the turn of the century to Rs 48 trillion at the end of FY25. NBFCs AUM as of FY19 was approximately Rs 23 trillion which grew at a 6-year CAGR of 13.2% to Rs 48 trillion as of FY25. Rapid revival in the economy is expected to drive consumer demand on FY26, leading to healthy growth in NBFCs. The NBFC credit is expected to grow at 15-17% between FY 25 and FY 28, driven by growth across retail, MSME and corporate segments continuing to be the primary drivers. HDB Financial Services Limited being one of the leading and the fastest growing NBFC is well-positioned to capitalize on the growth opportunities within the sector and the company aims to diversify and expand addressable customer segments by widening and enhancing product offering and continue to expand pan-India omni-channel distribution network.

HDB’s initial issue is priced at 3.4x TTM P/B (considered equity raise for calculating TTM BV) compared to the peer average of 4.4x TTM P/B. We believe the issue is attractively priced considering its parentage, peer group ROA average and its growth potential.

On the return front, HBDFSL has reported ROA at 2.1% in FY25 (vs 2.7% in FY24), while ROE declined from 17.9% in FY24 to 14.6% in FY25. GNPA and NNPA both increased from 1.9% and 0.6% in FY24 to 2.3% and 1.0% in FY25, respectively, as a result of slippages and write-offs during the fiscal. Despite the relatively lower return ratios and profitability growth, we remain optimistic of the company’s longer -term growth trend supported by a strong brand parentage, diversified liability franchise supported by a strong credit rating of AAA and a pan-India presence. The issue is valued at a P/B ratio of 3.9x at the upper price band based on FY25 book value, which we believe to be fairly valued compared to its peers.

We think as it is backed by the brand strength and operational discipline of its promoter, HDFC Bank, HDB has demonstrated consistent growth, strong underwriting capabilities, and resilient asset quality— evidenced by its low GNPA and NNPA ratios. We also think with over 19 million customers, a granular loan book, and a robust phygital distribution network of 1,771 branches and 140,000+ retail touchpoints, the company is well positioned to capture underpenetrated credit demand, particularly among “new to credit” borrowers. By looking at the financials, the company has demonstrated a a revenue growth of 14.3% in FY2024 and 15% in FY2025, with net profit rising by 25.6% in FY2024, though witnessing a modest decline of 11.6% in FY2025, mainly on account of two- fold increase in provision. On valuation parse at the upper price band of ₹740/-, the issue is asking a market cap of ₹ 61,388 cr. Based on FY 2025 earnings and fully diluted post-IPO paid up capital, the company is asking for Price to book ratio (P/B) of 3.5x which seems fairly valued looking at its industry average ~3.5-4x. Given its strong parentage, proven execution across cycles, diversified loan mix, and digital-first approach, we believe HDB Financial Services is well positioned to benefit from India’s ongoing financial inclusion and expanding retail credit demand.Hence, looking at all attributes we recommend investors to “SUBSCRIBE” the HDB Financial Services Ltd IPO for long term perspective.Mehta Equities 12:46 | June 25, 2025HDB Financial Limited IPO Live: Subscribed 0.17 times HDB Financial Limited has been subscribed 0.17 times as at 12.42 pm on June 25, 2025.

HDB’s asset quality is superior to peers on the back of its strong ownership and management pedigree. Its loan growth has been in line with peers over last 3 years. However we note that owing to HDB’s prudent focus on quality of customers, it earns a lower spread vis-à-vis peers. Also HDB’s operational cost is elevated. Thus HDB has managed to deliver ROA in the range of between 2 to 3% over last 3 years with FY25 post IPO ROA of 2.0%. This is below the peer average of 3.2% and Bajaj Finance’s 5.0% witnessed in FY25. Although we believe that HDB should be valued at a substantial discount to Bajaj Finance, its superior parentage and asset quality performance lead us to believe that it is attractively valued from a long term perspective upon comparing with Chola which has ROA of 2.4% and is being valued at 5.5x FY25 compared to HDB’s 3.4x (post IPO). Also HDB’s valuation is in line with the peer average which provides us comfort. Therefore, we recommend SUBSCRIBE to the issue, with a Long-term POSITIVE outlookNirmal Bang12:37 | June 25, 2025HDB Financial Services IPO Live: Tarun Singh, MD and Founder, Highbrow Securities, says the launch timing coincides with a Goldilocks period for NBFCs Timing the Tide: Cyclical Sweet Spot or Regulatory Compulsion?The IPO’s June launch coincides with a Goldilocks period for NBFCs – credit growth remains robust at 15%+, asset quality metrics have normalized post-pandemic, and risk appetite is returning to rural markets. However, beneath these favorable conditions lurk structural challenges: rising cost of funds (HDB’s NIMs compressed 30 bps in FY24), increasing competition from new-age fintechs, and the perennial volatility of unsecured lending (27% of HDB’s portfolio). HDFC Bank’s decision to monetize part of its 94% stake through a ₹10,000 crore OFS while retaining 74% ownership suggests cautious optimism – they’re taking money off the table but maintaining skin in the game. The fresh ₹2,500 crore capital infusion will strengthen HDB’s tier-1 capital adequacy (currently at 16.8%), providing ammunition to chase growth while maintaining healthy buffers. For investors, the key consideration isn’t whether HDB is a good company (its 2.26% GNPA and 23% CAGR loan book growth confirm it is), but whether it can translate its HDFC lineage and pan-India presence into superior returns in a maturing market. In many ways, HDB’s IPO represents the NBFC sector’s transition from its “wild west” days to a more regulated, institutional phase. Its performance post-listing will reveal much about public market appetite for steady, diversified lenders in an environment where specialists often steal the spotlight. The company’s fate won’t just belong to its shareholders, but will serve as a barometer for the entire NBFC sector’s next chapter.- Tarun Singh, MD and Founder, Highbrow Securities, says 12:18 | June 25, 2025HDB Financial IPO Live Today: Not dependent on HDFC Bank for operational purposes, says HDB Financial CEO IPO-bound non-banking finance company (NBFC) HDB Financial Services does not get or give any business leads to HDFC Bank or share any office space with the latter, and is not reliant on its parent for operational purposes, MD & CEO G Ramesh, told businessline in an interaction. “We originate our business ourselves, we don’t get any leads from any of our promoter companies. We underwrite our own business, and operate 1,771 branches of HDB Financial Services. They are our own branches and there is no shared space with HDFC Bank. And our technology stack is different than the bank, which makes our business independent,” he said.His comments come in the backdrop of the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) 2024 draft norms which state that only a single entity within a bank group can undertake a particular form of permissible business.

First, it underscores the RBI’s push to bring systemically important NBFCs (like HDB, classified in the “upper layer”) under greater market discipline through public listings. Second, it highlights how banks are reluctantly reducing stakes in lucrative NBFC subsidiaries ahead of anticipated ownership caps.Third, and most importantly, the offering serves as a referendum on whether generalist NBFCs can command premium valuations in a market that increasingly rewards niche lenders. - Tarun Singh, MD and Founder, Highbrow Securities, says Stay tuned.

Coming at a time when RBI is pushing large NBFCs toward listing (with a September 2025 deadline), this IPO represents both a regulatory compliance exercise and a strategic coming-of-age for HDFC Bank’s 17-year-old shadow lending arm. The timing is telling: with credit growth outpacing GDP expansion and NBFCs capturing 40% of new retail loans, HDB’s public listing offers a calibrated entry point into India’s formalisation of credit. - Tarun Singh, MD and Founder, Highbrow Securities, saysStay tuned.

Tightening liquidity or rising interest rates could impact margins and loan growth. ❑ Regulatory Risk: RBI’s evolving norms for NBFCs could affect operations, compliance costs, and capital requirements. ❑ Competition: Intense competition from banks, fintechs, and other NBFCs may pressure yields and affect credit quality. ❑ Limited Transparency: Being unlisted, HDB provides less public disclosure than listed peers, limiting investor visibility10:25 | June 25, 2025HDB Financial Services IPO Live: Booked 4% so far HDB Financial Services IPO has been subscribed 0.04 times as at 10.18 am on June 25, its opening day.The NII portion has been booked 0.07 times, retail 0.05 times, employee portion 0.29 times and reserved for shareholders 0.07 times.

The company is categorized as an Upper layer NBFC (NBFC-UL) by RBI. Its lending products are offered through three business verticals which is Enterprise lending (39.3%), Asset lending (38%) and consumer finance (22.7%). The company’s loan book comprises 73% secured loans and 27% unsecured loans, with its customer base primarily consisting of salaried individuals, self-employed professionals, and business owners. GNPA stood at 2.3% and NNPA at 1% for FY25. At the higher price band, the issue is valued at a P/BV of 3.4x (based on post-issue BVPS), which is in line with the peer average, making the issue appear fully priced. While the company has delivered steady growth in interest income driven by the expansion of its gross loan book, profitability has been impacted by interest rate volatility, leading to a decline in PAT for FY25.

HDFC,HDFC Bank stock to be in focus after Mehta family's FIR against CEO over Lilavati Trust allegations,https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/hdfc-bank-stock-to-be-in-focus-after-mehta-familys-fir-against-ceo-over-lilavati-trust-allegations-11749397469101.html,"HDFC Bank shares are set to be in focus of stock market investors on Monday, 9 June 2025, after the Mehta family filed an FIR (First Information Report) against the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Sashidhar Jagdishan on Sunday. The institutional lender called the FIR action “malicious and baseless” and said that the senior officials are currently being targeted by ‘unscrupulous persons’ who aim to abuse the legal process of recovering long outstanding loans from a defaulter named Splendour Gems Ltd. “Having exhausted all legal avenues without success, these individuals have now resorted to launching personal attacks against HDFC Bank and its MD & CEO in a clear attempt to malign their reputation and intimidate HDFC Bank into halting its recovery actions,” said the bank in the official statement. This FIR comes despite the Debt Recovery Tribunal order from 2004, which granted HDFC Bank the ‘recovery certificate’ for the outstanding dues, which remain “substantially unpaid” by the defaulter. The Mehta family-owned Splendour Gems defaulted on its loans in 2001. Lilavati Kirtilal Mehta Medical Trust is also owned and controlled by the Mehta family, which was seeking the HDFC Bank CEO's suspension and legal prosecution over alleged involvement in financial fraud and fund corruption related to the trust. According to Mint's earlier report, the Lilavati Trust has also accused eight individuals, including former bank employees, of financial fraud and misappropriation of the trust's funds. The bank plans to pursue legal methods to recover public funds and will address the retaliatory actions taken by the Mehta family. HDFC Bank shares closed 1.42 per cent higher at ₹1,978.70 after Friday's stock market session, compared to ₹1,950.90 at the previous market close. The company disclosed the FIR filing on Sunday evening, 8 June 2025. The shares of the largest private bank in India have given stock market investors more than 100 per cent return on their investment in the last five years and 26.69 per cent gains in the last one-year period. On a year-to-date (YTD) basis, the shares have gained 10.95 per cent in 2025, and are trading 3.39 per cent higher in the last five trading sessions. HDFC shares hit their 52-week high levels at ₹1,996.30 on Friday, 6 June 2025, while the 52-week low level was at ₹1,546.85 on 6 June 2024, exactly one year ago. The institutional lender's market capitalisation (M-Cap) stands at over ₹15.15 lakh crore as of the market close on Friday, 6 June 2025. Disclaimer: This story is for educational purposes only.

Here’s what to expect from HDFC Bank Q4 Results and ICICI Bank Q4 Results: HDFC Bank, the largest private sector lender in India, is expected to report marginal growth in its net profit and net interest income (NII), with margins likely to remain under pressure. According to estimates by brokerage firm Motilal Oswal Financial Services (MOFSL), HDFC Bank is expected to post a 3.2% year-on-year (YoY) rise in net profit for Q4FY25, with NII growth seen at 5.5% YoY. Cost ratios are projected to remain stable, while margins may see a slight moderation. Slippages are expected to be contained, and asset quality is anticipated to improve. The bank’s deposit growth in the March 2025 quarter is estimated at 14.6%, while loan growth is seen at 3.8%. “HDFC Bank is enhancing operational efficiency to maintain stable cost ratios while continuing investments. The cost-to-income and cost-to-asset ratios are expected to decline to ~40% and 1.7%, respectively, by FY27. With strategic liability management, margin recovery, and disciplined asset quality, HDFC Bank is poised for steady growth,” MOFSL said. It projects RoA and RoE at 1.8% and 14.1% by FY27, with the bank trading at 2.2x FY26E ABV. ICICI Bank is estimated to report strong performance in Q4FY25, supported by healthy business growth and further improvement in asset quality. The private lender’s net profit is expected to rise 12.3% YoY, with NII likely to grow 9.2% YoY. Margins are also expected to expand during the quarter. “ICICI Bank is set for top performance with robust loan growth, solid asset quality, and leading returns, targeting RoA and RoE of 2.2% and 17% by FY27E.

The brokerage firm has a ‘Buy’ rating for both the banking stocks, with HDFC Bank share price target at ₹2,100 and ICICI Bank share price target of ₹1,600 apiece. Anshul Jain, Head of Research at Lakshmishree Investment, believes ICICI Bank could outperform in the near term and the stock offers a more attractive risk-reward. “ICICI Bank stock price has broken out of a 140-day long Volatility Contraction Pattern (VCP) at ₹1,362. While volumes are yet to pick up, the price action remains strong, suggesting further upside. A move towards ₹1,500 appears likely in the short term. Meanwhile, HDFC Bank is hovering around its all-time high of ₹1,880, where some profit booking may occur,” said Jain. Heading into Q4 results, Jain said that ICICI Bank offers a more attractive risk-reward setup and could outperform in the near term. HDFC Bank shares closed 1.53% higher at ₹1906.55 apiece, while ICICI Bank shares settled 3.68% higher at ₹1406.65 apiece on the BSE.

The lender’s shares have gained 10% on a year-to-date basis. Over a longer period, the stock offered a 29% return in the last three years and a substantial 320% return in five years. The share price continued its upward trend, rising 5% in April so far after a 12% gain in the last month and was up 9% in the past week and 29.48% in the past year. Analysts at Motilal Oswal highlighted that it is rare for a bank of ICICI Bank's size to surprise positively with its operating performance, especially amid a volatile macro environment and strong competition for deposits. They noted that the bank's continuous investment in technology has driven consistent productivity gains, helping to maintain cost ratios. Furthermore, the business mix has shifted towards a higher-yielding portfolio, with balanced growth across different segments. Nuvama also emphasized ICICI Bank's ability to deliver strong and above-expected earnings growth even in the current volatile macroeconomic conditions, suggesting an expansion in the stock’s premium compared to its peers. The stable secured asset quality and a contingency provisioning buffer of ₹13,100 crore provide additional comfort. The significant NIM expansion in Q4FY25, despite expectations of a modest increase, was particularly commended. This positive movement has led to significant increase in the share price of the Bank, currently the bank’s share price is trading at ₹1,414.70.

SBI,Stock to buy for long-term: SBI sees big upside in this small-cap stock priced below ₹100,https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/stock-to-buy-for-long-term-sbi-sees-big-upside-in-small-cap-stock-hi-tech-pipes-priced-below-rs-100-11749181359354.html,"Domestic brokerage house SBI Securities has reiterated its ‘Buy’ rating on Hi-Tech Pipes, assigning a revised target price of ₹138—an upside potential of 43.4 percent from the current market price of ₹96.2. The brokerage said the company delivered a strong performance in the March 2025 quarter and remains well-placed for growth, backed by new capacity additions and a rising share of value-added products. During the March quarter, Hi-Tech Pipes posted consolidated revenue of ₹733.7 crore, EBITDA of ₹34.9 crore, and profit after tax (PAT) of ₹17.6 crore. SBI Securities said revenue and PAT grew by 7.7 percent and 55.8 percent year-on-year, respectively, while EBITDA declined slightly by 1.2 percent. Sales volumes rose 7.7 percent year-on-year to 2.14 lakh tonnes, driven by strong demand from the infrastructure and construction sectors. SBI Securities highlighted that the company’s Sikandrabad and Sanand Phase-2 units are in advanced stages of commissioning and are expected to commence operations in FY26. Trial production at both facilities is likely to begin shortly. Once operational, these units will increase Hi-Tech Pipes’ total manufacturing capacity to 1 million tonnes per annum (MTPA), up from the current 0.75 MTPA. The brokerage further stated that for FY26 and FY27, it has assumed annual capacity additions of 0.6 MTPA each, which translates into a 23.9 percent compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in volumes. SBI Securities expects EBITDA per tonne to improve from ₹3,297 in FY25 to ₹3,639 in FY26 and ₹3,852 in FY27, aided by the higher contribution from value-added products (VAPs). According to SBI Securities, Hi-Tech Pipes is transitioning its portfolio from generic steel pipes to more value-added offerings like solar torque tubes and color-coated roofing sheets. The contribution of VAPs is projected to rise from 36 percent in FY25 to 42 percent in FY26 on a blended basis, thereby enhancing the company’s overall margin profile. Additionally, SBI Securities pointed out that the company is lining up fresh capital expenditure for FY27, aiming to boost capacity by another 25–30 percent. This includes groundwork at the Sri City project in Chennai and continued development of the Sanand Phase-2 facility. The management’s long-term vision is to scale up to a capacity of 2 MTPA by FY29. At the current market price, the stock trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 18.1x and 12.5x on FY26 and FY27 EPS estimates of ₹5.3 and ₹7.6, respectively. SBI Securities values the stock at 18x FY27 earnings to arrive at the target price of ₹138. The smallcap stock lost over 14 percent in the last 1 year. In June so far, the stock has advanced almost 2 percent following a 5.6 percent jump in May. Before that, it was in the red for 8 straight months between September 2024 and April 2025. Currently it is over 64 percent away from its 52-week high of ₹210.75, hit in September 2024. Meanwhile, it is trading closer to its 52-week low of ₹81.53, hit last month. In conclusion, SBI Securities believes that Hi-Tech Pipes is well-positioned to benefit from robust demand in the structural steel tubes segment, rising VAP contribution, and ongoing capacity expansion. The brokerage maintained its bullish outlook, highlighting strong long-term growth visibility and an attractive valuation, offering investors a potential 44.2 percent return from current levels.

SBI,"SBI Q4 Results: Net profit drops 10% to ₹18,642.5 crore; 1,590% dividend, fundraising declared",https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/sbi-q4-results-net-profit-drops-10-to-rs-18-642-5-crore-1-590-dividend-fundraising-declared-11746262418875.html,"SBI Q4 Results: State Bank of India (SBI) announced its January March quarter results for fiscal 2024-25 (Q4FY25) on Saturday, May 3, reporting a drop of 10 per cent in standalone net profit to ₹18,642.59 crore, compared to ₹20,698.35 crore in the corresponding period last year. The public sector bank (PSB)'s net interest income (NII) stood at ₹42,774 crore. India's largest state-run lender's operating profit for FY25 crossed ₹1 lakh crore and grew by 17.89 per cent year-on-year (YoY) to ₹1,10,579 crore while operating profit for Q4FY25 grew by 8.83 per cent YoY to ₹31,286 crore. The PSB declared a dividend of ₹15.90 per share (1,590 per cent) for FY25. The record date of the dividend is fixed on May 16 and the payment date is May 30, 2025. “The Central Board of the Bank, has declared a Dividend of ₹15.90 per equity share (1,590 per cent) for the financial year ended 31.03.2025. The record date for determining the eligibility of members entitled to receive dividend on equity shares is Friday, 16.05.2025 and dividend payment date is fixed as 30.05.2025,” said SBI in a regulatory filing to the stock exchanges. SBI also declared fundraising of upto ₹25,000 crore in FY26 via qualified institution placement (QIP) or follow on public offer (FPO). “…Raising of equity capital for an amount aggregating upto ₹25,000 crore (including share premium) in one or more tranches during FY 2025-26 through Qualified Institutions Placement (QIP)/ Follow- on Public Offer (FPO) or any other permitted mode or a combination thereof in such manner and on such terms and conditions as may be deemed appropriate, in accordance with the applicable Acts/ Regulations/ Guidelines and subject to receipt of all requisite approvals,” said SBI in its exchange filing. The board of the state-run bank has said ealier that it will discuss the proposal for fresh capital either through a follow-on public share sale, rights issue or qualified institutional placement on May 3. The fund raise plan by SBI comes at a time when Bank Nifty is near its record high, driven by bullishness among investors due to the sector’s relative insulation from tariff-related turmoil. Total income increased to ₹1,43,876 crore in March quarter from ₹1,28,412 crore in the same period a year ago, SBI said in a regulatory filing. During the quarter, the bank earned an interest income of ₹1,19,666 crore as against ₹1,11,043 crore a year ago. The bank saw an improvement in asset quality, with gross non-performing assets (NPAs) declining to 1.82 per cent of the total advances in the fourth quarter from 2.24 per cent as at March-end 2024. Similarly, net NPAs eased to 0.47 per cent as against 0.57 per cent. On a consolidated basis, SBI's net profit in the quarter fell 8 per cent to ₹19,600 crore as against ₹21,384 crore in the same period a year ago. Total income, however, increased to ₹1,79,562 crore from ₹1,64,914 crore. The bank's net profit for FY25 stood at ₹70,901 crore, witnessing a growth of 16.08 per cent YoY. The gross non performing asset (NPA) ratio stood at 1.82 per cent and improved by 42 bps YoY. The net NPA ratio was at 0.47 per cent improved by 10 bps YoY. SBI also revised its credit growth downwards to 12-13% from 14-16% earlier. The bank’s loan book stood at ₹42.2 lakh crore at the end of March 2025. That said the management said that the bank has a corporate loan pipeline of ₹3 lakh crore. “I think the uncertainty on tariffs is going to impact the overall economic scenario and investment scenario. So, from that background, we believe that there will be some moderation in the credit growth phase,” said CS Setty, chairman, SBI SBI also warned of pressure on net interest margin going forward as RBI is expected to cut rates going forward. “We expect another 50 base point rate cuts and starting with 25 base point in the next meeting. This means there is definitely going to be some pressure on the margins. We are not able to put any number on the margin pressure, but pressure is definitely going to be there because some of the portfolio gets repriced immediately with the policy rate cut while the deposits will take some time and the lag is generally 12 to 18 months for the existing stock to get repriced while the incremental deposits will get immediately repriced as we cut the rates on the deposits,” said Setty.

SBI,"Jefferies shares ""buy"" call for SBI, sees 21% potential upside on healthy outlook",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/jefferies-shares-buy-call-for-sbi-sees-21-potential-upside-on-healthy-outlook-13150297.html,"Global brokerage firm Jefferies issued a “buy” recommendation on State Bank of India (SBI), assigning a target price of Rs 960 per share, implying a potential upside of 22 percent. According to the firm’s analysts, although economic activity in the first quarter was relatively subdued, the outlook is expected to improve by the second and third quarters, aided by the Reserve Bank of India’s monetary relief measures and the impact of tax cuts. Jefferies projects a credit growth of 12 percent and deposit growth of 10 percent for the public sector lender, supported by adequate liquidity buffers. The bank is also expected to maintain a return on assets (RoA) of 1 percent despite facing near-term pressure on net interest margins (NIM) due to anticipated rate cuts. In the final quarter of Fiscal Year 2025, SBI reported a decline in net profit, although net interest income (NII) registered a modest increase. Specifically, net profit dropped 10 percent compared to the same period last year, while NII rose by 2.7 percent to Rs 42,775 crore. On the positive side, SBI’s asset quality showed sequential improvement. The gross non-performing assets (GNPA) ratio declined to 1.82 percent in the January–March quarter from 2.07 percent in the preceding quarter. The net NPA ratio also improved to 0.47 percent from 0.53 percent. Geojit Financial Services also turned more optimistic, upgrading SBI to a “buy” from “hold” with a revised target price of Rs 888 per share. The firm expects credit growth to remain strong and resilient, even in a softening interest rate environment, and sees the bank sustaining healthy return on equity and return on assets. Among the 42 brokerages tracking SBI, 34 maintain a “buy” rating, 7 suggest “hold,” and only 1 recommends “sell.” Despite the bullish stance from analysts, shares of SBI have declined by 1.5 percent over the past month, even as the benchmark Nifty 50 index rose by 0.4 percent in the same period.

SBI,"Bank Nifty falls for 7th time in 9 sessions; PNB, IndusInd, SBI decline up to 2%",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/bank-nifty-falls-for-7th-time-in-9-sessions-pnb-indusind-sbi-decline-up-to-2-13014163.html,"Banking shares came under selling pressure on Tuesday, dragging the Bank Nifty index lower for the seventh time in nine sessions since April 23, as investors turned cautious ahead of the US Federal Reserve's key interest rate decision due on Wednesday. The Bank Nifty slipped over 600 points to move below the 55,000 mark at 54,271.40. 11 of the 12 constituents of the index settled in the red, reflecting broad-based weakness across both public and private sector lenders. Bank of Baroda was the top loser in the pack, settling 10.91 percent lower at Rs 221.95 per share on the NSE after the PSU lender reported 7 percent drop in net interest income (NII) and a rise in provisions. Canara Bank followed closely, closing 5.22 percent lower at Rs 92.09 apiece. Punjab National Bank fell as much as 4.93 percent to settle at Rs 94.50 on the NSE. IndusInd Bank dropped 2.64 percent, while Canara Bank declined 2.24 percent. Selling pressure also extended to heavyweight names like State Bank of India and Kotak Mahindra Bank, which declined between 0.60 percent and 2.08 percent. Analysts attributed the fall to weaker-than-expected quarterly earnings and broader uncertainty in the market. Kotak Mahindra Bank on Saturday reported a 7.57 percent drop in consolidated net profit to Rs 4,933 crore for the March quarter of FY25, hit by rising stress in its microlending portfolio. Similarly, State Bank of India saw its net profit slip 8.34 percent year-on-year to Rs 19,600 crore for the January-March quarter, largely due to a decline in net interest margins. Though SBI reported a 2.69 per cent rise in core net interest income to Rs 42,775 crore, its net interest margin dropped by 32 basis points year-on-year to 3.15 per cent, despite loan growth of over 12 per cent. Private sector majors HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank also traded lower in Tuesday's trade. Investor sentiment was further weighed down by uncertainty around the JSW-Bhushan Steel deal and global cues. Market participants are awaiting cues from the US Fed's policy stance, which will be crucial in shaping near-term direction for equities, especially rate-sensitive sectors like banking. ""Globally, US markets ended slightly lower due to profit-booking after a nine-day rally. Concerns over US-China trade negotiations and the upcoming Federal Reserve decision are keeping investors on edge,"" said Vikas Jain, Head of Research at Reliance Securities.

SBI,"Now is the time to have confidence and lend across segments: SBI chairman
",https://www.moneycontrol.com/banking/now-is-the-time-to-have-confidence-and-lend-across-segments-sbi-chairman-article-12949356.html,"State Bank of India expects to maintain a credit growth of 14–16 percent in FY26, chairman Challa Sreenivasulu Setty has said, adding there are no asset quality concerns and now is the time to step up lending. Speaking exclusively to Moneycontrol, Setty said, “With a lot of measures, both in terms of budgetary and monetary policy, we assume and expect that the credit growth will continue at the same pace next financial year.” As estimated, SBI will end FY25 with a 14–16 percent loan growth, he said. Setty, however, expects the banking system’s growth to moderate to around 11–12 percent in FY26. “SBI may have two percentage points more (growth),” he added. The chairman is confident that the retail and corporate loan books of SBI will contribute adequately to this growth target for the next fiscal. “Retail loans have been growing faster than the corporate. I think we are one of the outliers where the corporate growth is also significant,” Setty, who took over as the chairman in August, said. Also read: SBI Chairman CS Setty says mission to change the bank is 'very close to heart' In the December quarter, SBI’s corporate book grew by 14.5 percent and the bank had good visibility on term and working capital loan books. Asked if it was time to be a little cautious, the SBI chairman dismissed the suggestion, saying banks are going through the most benign asset quality cycle. “This is the time to put some confidence in the system and start looking at lending to sectors across agriculture, SME, retail, corporate,” he said. Setty is confident that if SBI grows at a 12 percent annually compounded rate, it can produce another SBI organically in six years. “We are busy doing our own business internally and organically there is great potential for this organisation,” he said. Setty also told Moneycontrol that the upgraded version of SBI’s mobile banking YONO 2.0 will be launched by July, attributing the launch delay to several new features. SBI has devised a new underwriting mechanism, the business rule engine, which enables it to sanction a loan to a SME borrower within 15 – 30 minutes, Setty said. The borrower has to give consent to the bank to access their GST statement and furnish income tax returns and processing is done in minutes. The bank gave Rs 34,000 crore in loans to SMEs under this data-based mechanism, he said. Discover the latest Business News, Budget 2025 News, Sensex, and Nifty updates.

Cities on TCS’s radar include Bengaluru, Kolkata, Hyderabad, Kochi, Coimbatore, and Visakhapatnam.In Bengaluru, TCS has made two major acquisitions—1.4–1.6 million sq ft from Sattva-Darshita for Rs 2,250 crore and 3.2 million sq ft from TRIL for Rs 1,625 crore. Together, these are expected to add 25,000 seats. Additionally, TCS leased 800,000 sq ft at 360 Degrees Business Park in Electronic City, further expanding its presence in India’s tech capital.In Kolkata, the company is developing 30 acres across its Sanchita Park and Bengal Silicon Valley Hub campuses, adding capacity for 16,500 seats—12,500 of which will be ready in 2025.TCS has also leased new office spaces in Coimbatore and Hyderabad, while in Visakhapatnam, the firm secured 21.6 acres on a 99-year lease from the government. In Kochi, it is acquiring 37 acres in the Kinfra Electronics Manufacturing Cluster for Rs 690 crore.Live EventsAccording to industry experts, TCS’s real estate moves point to a revival in the commercial office sector and confidence in India’s talent ecosystem. The firm’s investment in both metro and tier-2 cities suggests a long-term strategy to diversify and scale its delivery capabilities.Although TCS has not issued an official comment due to its silent period, its aggressive office expansion clearly signals preparation for future demand, return-to-office models, and hybrid workforce strategies.In April NASSCOM said that the Indian domestic tech market has maintained its growth momentum and has been growing faster than exports. ""This growth is being driven by several tech companies that are focused on building in India for India, undertaking contracts for digital transformation of Indian enterprises and remain bullish about upcoming opportunities in the market,"" the industry association added.(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)Read More News onIndia’s largest IT playertcs new officestcs new citiesTata Consultancy Services expansionnew IT campuses in IndiaTCS office locationsBengaluru office spaceTCS bengalurutata consultancy services(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) share price opened at ₹3,082.85 against its previous close of ₹3,021.40 and jumped 4.6 per cent to an intraday high of ₹3,159 in a weak market. Around 10:25 AM, M&M shares traded 2.81 per cent higher at ₹3,106.45. Equity benchmark Sensex was 0.33 per cent down at 80,531 at that time. M&M shares jumped after the automobile company reported strong growth in its standalone net profit and revenue for Q4FY25. M&M reported a 21.85 per cent year-on-year (YoY) jump in its Q4FY25 standalone net profit to ₹2,437.14 crore, compared to ₹2,000.07 crore in the same quarter last year. Standalone revenue from operations grew by 24.5 per cent YoY to ₹31,353.40 crore from ₹25,182.82 crore. The company sold 2,53,028 units of vehicles in the January-March 2025 quarter, up 18 per cent from 2,15,280 units in the same quarter last year. M&M shares have been in the green for the last four consecutive sessions. On May 5, when the company announced its Q4FY25 earnings, the company's shares settled 3.11 per cent higher. Till May 5, the stock has jumped nearly 38 per cent over the last year, hitting a 52-week high of ₹3,276.30 on February 10 this year and a 52-week low of ₹2,159.10 on May 13 last year. Several brokerage firms expressed their positive views about the stock after the company's strong Q4 numbers and healthy growth outlook. Brokerage firm Motilal Oswal Financial Services maintained a buy call on the stock with a target price of ₹3,482, implying a 15 per cent upside potential. Motilal believes M&M is well-placed to outperform across its core businesses, led by a healthy recovery in rural areas and new product launches across both the UVs and tractors segments. Motilal pointed out while M&M has ""outperformed its own targets of earnings growth and RoE of 18 per cent in each of FY24 and FY25, it remains committed to delivering 15-20 per cent EPS growth and 18 per cent RoE, ensuring sustained profitability and shareholder value."" ""Given the sustained demand momentum in UVs and tractors, we have raised our earnings estimates by 4 per cent and 6 per cent for FY26 and FY27E, respectively. We estimate M&M to post a CAGR of nearly 13 per cent, 13 per cent and 18 per cent in revenue, EBITDA and PAT, respectively, over FY25-27E,"" said Motilal Oswal. Brokerage firm ICICI Securities has upgraded the stock to a 'buy' from an 'add', and increased the target price to ₹3,500 from ₹3,200 earlier. ""We envisage M&M’s strong performance continuing, led by its robust UV portfolio and FES segment’s healthier outlook. We upgrade it to a buy, from an add, with a SoTP-based target price of ₹3,500 versus ₹3,200, implying 24 times FY27E core EPS. Change in the target price is led by an 8 per cent and 9 per cent increase in FY26E and FY27E EPS, respectively, to account for higher volume growth and better margin performance,"" ICICI Securities said. Kotak Institutional Equities also maintained a buy with a fair value of ₹3,500. Kotak expects M&M to continue to outperform industry growth across the tractor and automotive segments, including the domestic PV and CV segments, given successful newer launches and strong brand equity. Kotak expects M&M's tractor segment to continue its uptrend, driven by higher reservoir levels and expectations of a normal monsoon. ""M&M continues to execute well by maintaining a leadership position in all three segments, which makes us constructive on the name,"" said Kotak. While the stock looks poised for a healthy growth in the long term due to strong fundamentals, some technical experts suggest booking some profits at the current juncture. ""Mahindra & Mahindra has delivered an impressive nearly 30 per cent rally and is now approaching the ₹3,100 mark. A bearish shark pattern has emerged on the daily chart within the ₹3,100– ₹3,200 zone—an area that also aligns with previous swing highs,"" said Jigar S. Patel, Senior Manager of Equity Research at Anand Rathi Share and Stock Brokers. ""This confluence suggests a potential resistance zone. Traders may consider booking partial profits in the ₹3,150– ₹3,200 range and look for buying opportunities on a healthy pullback,"" Patel said.

ONGC,"ONGC, Oil India share prices rise up to 4% as Israel-Iran conflict flares up crude prices further",https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/ongc-oil-india-share-prices-rise-up-to-4-as-israel-iran-conflict-flares-up-crude-prices-further-11749787133745.html,"Stock Market Today: ONGC and Oil India share prices gained up to 4% on Friday, June 13, amidst rising crude prices, led by the Israel-Iran conflict. ONGC share price was among the top gainers among the Nifty 50 stocks despite the stock market crash. Today, the Indian benchmark indices — the Sensex and Nifty 50 — tumbled over 1.5% each. These upstream oil producers stand among the beneficiaries of rising crude prices, as they help improve realisations for these oil producers. However, this rise in crude prices may not be favourable for many others. “The economic consequences of this Israeli strike can be profound if the attack and counterattack by Iran linger long. Israel has declared that the operation will last several days. Brent crude prices have flared up by around 12% to $78. It can rise further if Iran, in retaliation, closes the Strait of Hormuz, severely restricting oil supply,” said Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited. While sectors that use oil derivatives as inputs, like aviation, paints, adhesives and tyres, will be hit hard, oil producers like ONGC and Oil India will remain resilient, added Vijayakumar. Oil and Natural Gas Corporation or ONGC share price opened at ₹255.55 on the National Stock Exchange on Friday, more than 3% higher compared to the previous day's closing price of ₹247.88. ONGC share price gained further to the intraday high of ₹255.9. Oil India share price opened at ₹480 and further rose to intraday highs of ₹486, translating into gains of close to 4% for Oil India share price in intraday deals today.

ONGC,ONGC share price gains 10% in March: Jefferies sees over 45% upside in this PSU stock. Here's why,https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/ongc-share-price-gains-10-in-march-jefferies-sees-over-45-upside-in-this-psu-stock-heres-why-11743159870565.html,"PSU stock Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) has witnessed a sharp rally this month, surging 10%, amid a rebound in the Indian stock market after five months of back-to-back losses. In today's trade itself, ONGC share price surged as much as 5% amid reports that Saudi Aramco is in talks to invest in two planned refineries in India. According to a Reuters report, Aramco is in separate talks to invest in Bharat Petroleum Corp's planned refinery in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh and a proposed ONGC refinery in western Gujarat state, the sources said. On a longer time frame of five years, ONGC has jumped 283%, turning into a multibagger stock. Global brokerage Jefferies sees further scope for growth in the oil PSU company's shares, projecting a 47% upside from today's (March 28) close of ₹254.80. The brokerage highlighted several key reasons behind its bullish stance on the stock, such as strong production growth, a rise in the profitability of gas portfolio and expansion in the renewables business. The PSU oil company is targeting 5-6% annual production growth over FY26-28 on the back of ramp-up in crude and gas production from the KG basin by mid-CY25, new development at Daman and DSF2. ONGC has contracted BP as a technical service provider. Over the 10-year period of the contract, BP expects to increase crude oil/gas recovery by 44%/90% over ONGC's assumed recovery estimates. ""This should result in ~5% annual increase in crude and ~8% annual increase in gas production from the field FY27 onwards if BP succeeds. This could take ONGC's production growth CAGR to 10%+ over FY27-30,"" said Jefferies. The company expects ~20% of gas production to be eligible for new well gas price (US$ 8.5/mmbtu) in FY26 rising to ~100% by 2030. Furthermore, Jefferies highlighted that ONGC's Ayana acquisition is in line with its strategy of mature asset acquisition with land, grid access and PPAs in place. The current focus is on acquiring solar assets, with the company targeting 14% Equity IRR in these projects. ""We build in 2%/9% CAGR in crude/gas production but Mumbai High production growth poses upside risk to our est. We project 14% EPS CAGR over FY25-27 on production growth and better pricing in gas. The stock is discounting US$ 55 crude, making R-R favorable. Maintain Buy with PT of ₹375,"" Jefferies said. Disclaimer: This story is for educational purposes only.

For the entire financial year 2025, the oil major declared a total of 9 discoveries (5 in onland and 4 in offshore) in its operated acreages. Out of these, 7 are prospect (4 onland and 3 offshore) and 2 (1 in onland and 1 in offshore) are new pool discoveries. The company invested around Rs 62,000 crore in capital expenditure in FY25, including Rs 18,365 crore in OPaL, Rs 4,600 crore in ONGC Green Ltd for acquisition of PTC Energy and Ayana Renewables. Despite the fall in net profit, CLSA remained bullish on the stock. The international brokerage maintained a 'High Conviction Outperform' call for the stock, with a target price of Rs 360 per share. This implies an upside potential of nearly 47.5 percent from the stock's current market price. CLSA noted that the reported profit after tax was significantly lower than forecast, largely due to a big drywell write-off recognized in Q4. It also highlighted that the company's standalone oil and gas production rose 5 percent and 4 percent respectively on the back of rising output from KG-98/2 field. CLSA further said that ONGC's gas price realization rose by 4 percent QoQ, helped by increasing share of new well gas in its output. Jefferies kept a 'Buy' call on the stock, with a target price of Rs 375 apiece. This implies an upside potential of nearly 54 percent from the stock's current market price. The international brokerage said that Q4 standalone EBITDA was marginally below its estimate, but production and realization were more or less in line. Profit after tax was 31 percent below its estimate, on account of higher exploratory well write offs. Jefferies also noted that daily crude and gas production has risen for the second successive quarter. Motilal Oswal Financial Services also maintained a 'Buy' rating on ONGC. The domestic brokerage noted that the oil major's crude oil and gas sales were higher than its estimates. ""Higher-than-estimated DDA, dry well write-offs, and survey costs, along with lower-than-estimated other income, led to a miss on PAT,"" it said.

",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/ongc-shares-fall-3-following-weak-q3-earnings-jefferies-maintains-buy-12926204.html,"Shares of ONGC slipped 3 percent to Rs 254 in morning trade on February 1, the budget day, after the oil major disappointed investors with its 7 percent drop in consolidated net profit for the third quarter. The company's net profit stood at Rs 9,783.64 crore in the quarter ended December 31 of the current financial year, compared to Rs 10,511.23 crore in the same period of the previous financial year, an exchange filing said. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates The company had reported a net profit of Rs 9,878.44 crore in the September quarter, the filing showed.

In the September quarter, the revenue was reported at Rs 158329.1 crore. Following the result, Jefferies maintained a 'Buy' call on ONGC with a target price of Rs 375 per share. The company's Q3 standalone EBITDA was slightly ahead of estimates, supported by marginally higher domestic production and in-line realizations. However, profit fell short of expectations due to higher depreciation and amortization (D&A), lower dividend income, and increased tax rates. Consolidated profit was also below estimates, impacted by weaker performance from subsidiaries, the international brokerage added. The public sector undertaking has also announced an interim dividend of Rs 5 per equity share for the current financial year and February 7th has been fixed as the record date, the company statement said. At about 9:20 am, ONGC shares traded 2 percent lower at Rs 257. ONGC shares have had a decent start to the new year, rising 10 percent in January.

ONGC,Gas stocks in focus as govt hikes APM gas prices by 4%,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/gas-stocks-in-focus-as-govt-hikes-apm-gas-prices-by-4-12981042.html,"Shares of Indian gas companies, including Oil & Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) Ltd., Oil India Ltd., GAIL, and city gas distributors like Indraprastha Gas Ltd. (IGL), Mahanagar Gas Ltd. (MGL), and Gujarat Gas Ltd., are in focus on Tuesday, April 1, after the government increased gas prices under the Administered Price Mechanism (APM) by 4 percent. As of 10:00 am, ONGC shares were trading at Rs 246 and GAIL shares were trading at Rs 182 apiece, both with subtle gains, while shares of IGL and MGL were trading at a decline of over a percent, at Rs 200 and Rs 1,372, respectively. This is the first hike in APM gas prices since April 2023 which allowed for a 4 percent increase from the third year of implementation. The revised APM gas price is set at $ 6.75 per mmBtu for the April to September period, up from $ 6.5 per mmBtu in the first quarter of the year. Brokerage firm Jefferies, in a recent note, highlighted that reforms in gas and crude pricing could support ONGC's Earnings Per Share (EPS) to grow at a Compounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 14 percent over FY 2025 to FY 2027. This projection is seen as a positive trigger for ONGC, given the expected revenue boost from the price hike. The development also brings attention to city gas distributors like IGL and MGL, which have been under pressure recently. As of last Friday, shares of IGL were still down 28 percent from their peak, while MGL was down 30 percent. The revised pricing may offer a breather to these stocks, as investors assess the potential impact on margins and profitability.

Around 3.13 crore shares, or 2.5 percent of equity in ITC was exchanged in a block deal window, totalling Rs 12,100 crore in total. The shares were exchanged at the price of Rs 417 per share, which indicates a four percent discount from the previous session's close. At 12.30 pm, ITC shares were quoting Rs 420.7, lower by 3 percent on the NSE. ""The net proceeds from the block trade will also be utilised to extend the group's existing share buyback programme announced on 18 March 2024 (the ""Programme"") by an additional £200 million, taking the total amount to be repurchased in 2025 to £1.1 billion,"" said BAT, in a filing with the London Stock Exchange. Earlier, reports suggested that ITC's largest shareholder BAT will likely offload 2.3 percent of its stake in ITC to institutional investors via the block deal method, marking its second such sale, after selling a 3.5 percent stake through block deals for Rs 16,690 crore last year. Investment banks Citi and Goldman Sachs are working on the proposed transaction, noted industry sources. With the floor price of Rs 400 per share, the total size of the block deal will valued around $1.36 billion or Rs 11,600 crore. Following the block deal, BAT will remain a large shareholder of ITC, holding a 23.1 percent stake in the diversified conglomerate.

There can be no certainty that any such transaction will proceed, nor can there be any certainty as to the terms of any potential transaction. A further announcement will be made if and when appropriate.” If completed, the proceeds will be used to progress to within the target 2-2.5x adjusted net debt/adjusted EBITDA leverage corridor (adjusted for Canada) by the end of 2026 and to continue our sustainable buyback program by enabling an intended £200 million increase in the share buyback to a total of £1.1 billion in 2025.

This gain was accounted for under discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements. Adjusted for the exceptional gain, the net profit stood at ₹4,662 crore, lower than the ₹5,190 crore reported in the same quarter of the previous financial year. The revenue from operations during the reporting quarter came in at ₹20,376 crore, beating Street estimates and marking a 10% increase over the ₹18,561 crore reported in the March 2024 quarter.

ITC Ltd.,"ITC Hotels share price lists at ₹188 apiece on BSE, a discount of 31% to discovered price

ITC Hotels share price was listed at ₹188 apiece on the BSE, a discount of 30.37% to the discovered price of ₹270 per share. On NSE, ITC Hotels shares were listed at ₹180 apiece, a discount of 30.77% to the discovered price of ₹260 per share. After the listing, ITC Hotels shares extended the decline and were locked at 5% lower circuit on the BSE at ₹178.60 apiece. ITC Hotels is a demerged entity of cigarettes-to-FMCG conglomerate ITC Ltd. ITC Hotels listing date was fixed for today, January 29. ITC Hotels shares will be removed from Nifty 50 and Sensex on T+3 day, which is listing, plus three business days. ITC Hotels demerger ratio was 1:10, meaning existing ITC shareholders received 1 ITC Hotels share for every 10 ITC shares. The parent ITC Ltd retained a 40.0% stake in the new entity, with the remaining 60.0% distributed to shareholders. Following the demerger and listing of ITC Hotels Ltd, ITC Ltd shareholders are not expected to experience a material increase in value, as ITC Ltd's price will be adjusted to account for the holding company discount, said DevenChoksey Research. DevenChoksey Research values ITC shares on a Sum-of-the-Parts (SOTP) basis and has revised its target price to ₹520 post the demerger of its hotel business. Previously, the hotel segment was valued at an EV/EBITDA multiple of 17.3x. Following the demerger, the brokerage firm has adjusted the target price by ₹12 per share, accounting for the 40.0% retained holding and a 20.0% holding company discount, resulting in a revision of the target price from ₹534 to ₹520. “The demerger of ITC Ltd's hotel business unlocks value by allowing ITC to focus on its high-margin, cash-generative core segments, while the standalone hotels entity gains flexibility to capitalize on industry growth and attract strategic investors. This move enhances resource allocation, supports distinct growth trajectories for both entities, and is expected to improve valuation multiples. Accordingly, we upgrade our rating on ITC Ltd to ‘Buy’ from ‘Accumulate’, it said. ITC Hotels is one of the largest hotel companies with 140 hotels and ~13,000 operating keys as of October 2024. The company targets to grow its portfolio to 200+ hotels and 18,000+ keys by 2030. Around 35% of the hotel portfolio is owned by ITC Hotels and the balance is managed (including franchise model). The ARR and RevPAR of its owned hotels has grown 20%/18% YoY respectively in FY24 with occupancy level of 69%. The return ratios are healthy with RoCE of ~20%. It has a net cash surplus with negligible debt on books, thus providing healthy growth opportunity going ahead.

ITC Ltd.,"ITC Hotels Demerger Highlights: ITC shares trade ex-demerger, settle 2.75% lower on BSE",https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/itc-hotels-demerger-live-updates-bse-nse-hold-special-session-to-list-itc-hotels-share-price-11736134180084.html,"ITC Hotels Demerger Live Updates: ITC shares traded ex-hotels today as the ITC Hotels demerger record date was today. The stock exchanges, BSE and NSE held a special trading session to discover the fair price of ITC Hotels stock. At the end of this special session, ITC share price was adjusted by ₹26 or 5.4% at ₹455.60 on NSE and by ₹27 or 5.6% at ₹455 on BSE. The Street expected ₹15-20 per share adjustment for the hotel business. ITC Hotels share price will be calculated based on the difference between the closing prices of ITC shares on January 3, 2025, and the open price of ITC discovered during the SPOS (special pre-open session) on January 6, 2025. ITC Hotels demerger ratio is 1:10, i.e. shareholders will get one share of ITC Hotels for every 10 ITC shares held. ITC Hotels share listing will be done separately and the listing date is yet to be announced. Stay tuned to our ITC Hotels Demerger Live Blog for the latest updates. ITC share price closed the session at ₹442.50, 2.75% lower on the BSE. Meanwhile, on NSE, the stock settled at ₹445.35, down 2.25%. ITC shares traded ex-demerger in today's trade, which means the value of ITC shares are now ex-hotels business. ITC Hotels is India's second-largest hospitality entity, boasting 140 properties compared to peers such as Indian Hotels (232), EIH (23), and Lemon Tree (112). Based on proforma financials, ITC Hotels' valuation is pegged at ₹150 per share, applying a 25x EV/EBITDA multiple on FY26E. Systematix maintained a Hold rating on ITC with a target price of ₹500 (10% upside), noting that detailed company disclosures post-demerger will refine their estimates. ITC shares are trading at P/E multiples of 26x and 23x for FY26E and FY27E EPS, respectively. ITC Share Price Live: ITC’s cigarette business is expected to continue strong volume growth, supported by its dominant market position and pricing power. Additionally, the company is focused on improving margins in its non-cigarette FMCG segment, which should drive overall profitability in the near term. Post-demerger, ITC will focus on its core cigarette and FMCG businesses, benefiting from a more asset-light structure, improving capital efficiency and returns. This shift is expected to improve ITC’s return ratios substantially. ITC’s focus on improving profitability offers an attractive long-term upside, said Akriti Mehrotra, Research Analyst, StoxBox. ITC Share Price Live: Analysts at brokerage firm B&K Securities highlighted ITC Hotels’ strategic focus on an asset-light, managed-hotel model, which is expected to enhance Return on Capital Employed (RoCE). They have projected ITC Hotels' fair listing value at ₹145, based on a 25x EV/EBITDA multiple on FY26E EBITDA. However, potential supply pressures are anticipated due to British American Tobacco's (BAT) exit. With ITC stock currently trading at a P/E of 23.8x on FY27E EPS, B&K has maintained a Buy rating on ITC with an unchanged target price of ₹588, assigning a P/E of 29x on FY27E EPS of ₹20.4. ITC Share Price Live: Alongside the demerger announcement, ITC also disclosed acquisitions in the hospitality sector. Through its wholly-owned arm, Russell Credit, ITC acquired a 2.44 per cent stake in EIH (Oberoi Hotels) and a 0.53 per cent stake in HLV Ltd (The Leela). Following these acquisitions, ITC now holds 16.13 per cent of EIH and 8.11 per cent of HLV, further solidifying its presence in the luxury hotel industry. ITC Share Price Live: ITC share price was trading 2.65% lower at ₹442.95 apiece on the BSE. The stock was trading ex-Hotels business. ITC Share Price Live: ITC Hotels is one of the largest hotel companies with 140 hotels and ~13,000 operating keys as of October 2024. The company targets to grow its portfolio to 200+ hotels and 18,000+ keys by 2030. Around 35% of the hotel portfolio is owned by ITC Hotels and the balance is managed (including franchise model). The ARR and RevPAR of its owned hotels has grown 20% and 18% YoY respectively in FY24 with occupancy level of 69%. The return ratios are healthy with RoCE of ~20%. It has a net cash surplus with negligible debt on books, thus providing healthy growth opportunity going ahead. ITC Share Price Live: Most awaited ITC demerger gets price discovery at ₹455.60 and ₹27 adjusted towards ITC Hotel based on previous closing during the Special Pre-Open Session. The discovery price of ITC Hotel was in line with our expectations. Now ITC shareholders get 1 share of ITC Hotels for every 10 held of ITC. As per the index demerger listing rules ITC Hotels will be part of index and will be excluded from indices 3 business days after its listing date (if there are no circuit breakers). We are expecting the listing to be on or before February 2025 and based on the peer valuation expectation in the luxury hotel space, we are expecting the listing to be anywhere in the range of ₹100-125 per shares on conservative basis, said Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research), Mehta Equities Ltd. ITC Hotels' demerger is expected to unlock substantial shareholder value and enable the newly formed company to focus on growth in the luxury hospitality sector. Post demerger we continue to remain optimistic on the stocks and the demerger entity (ITC HOTEL). Hence, we recommend investors to hold and enjoy the unlocking shareholders value, Tapse added. ITC Share Price Live: ITC Hotels is expected to meet the criteria for inclusion in the MSCI Global Small Cap Indexes, based on Nuvama estimates. As a result, ITC Ltd. will remain part of the Standard Index. However, following the listing of ITC Hotels, the hotel business will be moved to the Small Cap Index and will no longer be part of the Standard Index. MSCI intends to apply a Price Adjustment Factor (PAF) to the market price of ITC on January 06, 2025 to reflect the spin-off. The PAF formula will be as follows: [P(t-1)] / [P(t)]. Since ITC HOTELS is not expected to start trading on the ex-date, MSCI intends to temporarily add a detached security ITC (DET) to the MSCI Global Standard Indexes as of close of January 06, 2025 (effective January 07, 2025). The price of ITC (DET) will be calculated by taking the difference between the closing price of ITC on January 03 and January 06. MSCI intends to maintain ITC (DET) at this price until ITC HOTELS begins trading. When ITC HOTELS starts trading, MSCI intends to apply a PAF to the market price of ITC (DET) based on terms of spin-off. Thereafter, MSCI intends to delete ITC (DET) from the MSCI Global Standard Indexes as of the close of the first trading day of ITC HOTELS using the closing market price of ITC HOTELS. Simultaneously, MSCI intends to add ITC HOTELS to the MSCI Global Small Cap Indexes as of the close of its first trading day, Nuvama explained. ITC Share Price Live: As per the current methodology, ITC Hotels stock needs to have at least a six month trading history to even qualify for derivative inclusion. Hence, ITC Hotels inclusion in the Futures & Options (F&O) segment is unlikely. After fulfilling all the quantitative qualification criteria for the derivative inclusion, ITC Hotels shares will need SEBI approval, which is quite subjective, said brokerage firm Nuvama. ITC Share Price Live: Centrum Broking expects in FY27E, ITC hotel business revenues to reach at ₹45.7 billion with an EBITDA margin of ~35% led by strong growth in domestic demand for the hospitality sector. Overall, it has a positive outlook on ITC Hotels demerger and retains a ‘Buy’ call on ITC shares with a target price of ₹583 apiece. ITC Share Price Live: ITC Hotels is one of the largest hotel companies with 140 hotels and ~13,000 operating keys as of October 2024. The company targets to grow its portfolio to 200+ hotels and 18,000+ keys by 2030. Around 35% of the hotel portfolio is owned by ITC Hotels and the balance is managed (including franchise model). The ARR and RevPAR of its owned hotels has grown 20%/18% YoY respectively in FY24 with occupancy level of 69%. The return ratios are healthy with RoCE of ~20%. It has a net cash surplus with negligible debt on books. ITC Share Price Live: In the short term, there is a possibility that few shareholders (especially ETFs) may have to forcefully exit ITC Hotels Ltd and this can create pressure on the stock price. We believe, any short term pressure on the ITC Hotels stock price will be a good opportunity for retail/HNI shareholders to accumulate quality business in their long term portfolio. Meanwhile, post demerger, investors can also continue to hold shares of ITC Ltd for long term given its diversified FMCG portfolio and steady growth in its core businesses (Cigarette & FMCG). Also, the demerger of its asset heavy hotels business will result in improved return ratios and cash flows. We believe, post demerger, ITC Ltd’s medium term fair value to be ₹525-550, said SBI Securities. ITC Share Price Live: For ITC Ltd shareholders, post demerger and listing of the ITC Hotels Ltd, there will be no material value addition as the price of ITC Ltd will get adjusted taking into account the holding company discount as shown above. Post listing of the ITC Hotels Ltd, investors will get an opportunity to participate directly in the growth story of ITC’s hotel business. Looking at the robust key addition pipeline for ITC Hotels and strong industry tailwinds, we believe ITC Hotels Ltd has potential to outperform ITC Ltd over a medium to long term period, said SBI Securities. ITC Share Price Live: ITC share price adjusted ₹27 lower after trading ex-date for hotels demerger session. ITC share price is currently around ₹455 apiece on the NSE and it has made a strong base at ₹430, which is expected to remain sacrosanct. ITC shareholders are advised to remain invested and add more in ₹430 to ₹450 zone, maintaining a strict stop loss of ₹100 below, said Ganesh Dongre, Senior Manager — Technical Research at Anand Rathi. According to him, fresh investors can also buy on dips in the ₹450 to ₹430 zone, maintaining a stop loss at ₹400. ITC stock may soon touch ₹480 and can touch ₹520 on breaking above ₹480 on a closing basis. ITC Share Price Live: ITC shares are now trading ex-demerger, which means the value of ITC shares are now ex-hotels business. At the end of a special trading session for the price discovery of ITC Hotels on stock exchanges BSE and NSE, the market has assigned ITC share price of ₹455.60. ITC Share Price Live: The special trading session on BSE and NSE to derive ITC Hotels share price has ended. ITC share price was adjusted by ₹26 or 5.4% at ₹455.60 on NSE and by ₹27 or 5.6% at ₹455 on BSE. ITC Share Price Live: The discovered price of ITC shares is at ₹455.60 apiece in special trading session on NSE after demerger of ITC Hotels. ITC Share Price Live: According to Nuvama, ITC share price is expected to be adjusted by ₹22-25 on January 6, reflecting its 40% stake in the hotel business and incorporating a 20% holding discount. Abhilash Pagaria of Nuvama anticipates that the initial market price for ITC Hotels shares could range between ₹150-175 per share. ITC Share Price Live: The average EV/EBITDA multiple of ITC Hotels’ industry peers, i.e. Indian Hotels and EIH Ltd, is 25.0x. Assuming that ITC Hotels will list at an EV/EBITDA multiple of 20.0x - 30.0x, the share price of ITC Hotels Ltd is expected to list in the range of ₹113 to ₹170 per share, according to the calculations done by SBI Securities. ITC Share Price Live: ITC Hotels will issue equity shares directly to the shareholders of ITC in a manner that about 60% stake is held directly by ITC shareholders proportionate to their shareholding in ITC and remaining about 40% stake to continue with ITC. Overall, existing ITC shareholders will hold 100% of ITC Hotels, i.e. about 60% directly and balance of about 40% through their shareholding in ITC. ITC Share Price Live:ITC Hotels will be 51st constituent in Nifty 50 and 31st constituent in Sensex and daily will be considered in weight calculations of Index. However as it is not traded live so its market-cap and price will remain constant until it lists. Post its listing for three trading days, live market-cap will be considered to calculate weight in all the indices, said brokerage firm Nuvama. ITC Share Price Live:ITC Hotels shares will be maintained in all the NSE and BSE indices at a constant price i.e., the discovered price during the special pre-open session on January 6. However, ITC Hotels stock will be dropped from all the NSE and BSE indices at the last traded price which is effective at the open of ITC Hotels listing date + 3 business days. If the stock hits circuit limits, the exclusion will be postponed by two trading days each time. For instance: if ITC Hotels lists on February 10, 2025 then stock will compulsorily be deleted on February 13, 2025. ITC Share Price Live: BSE and NSE are conducting a special pre-open session from 9.00 am to 9.45 am to discover ITC Hotels stock price. Normal trading in ITC shares will resume at 10.00 am onwards. ITC Hotels share price will be calculated based on the difference between the closing prices of ITC shares on January 3, 2025, and the open price of ITC discovered during the SPOS (special pre-open session) on January 6, 2025. ITC Hotels demerger record date is today, January 6, and ITC shares will trade ex-demerger today.

ITC Ltd.,"ITC Q3 Results 2025 Highlights: Net profit falls 7% to ₹4,935 crore, interim dividend of ₹6.5 per share declared",https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/itc-q3-results-2025-live-updates-itc-q3-earnings-profit-itc-cigarette-volumes-itc-share-price-itc-dividend-itc-hotels-11738812329479.html,"ITC Q3 Results 2025 Highlights: On Thursday, diversified conglomerate ITC Ltd announced a 7% year-on-year decline in its consolidated net profit for the quarter ending December 31, 2024, reaching ₹4,935 crore. This profit is attributed to the company's owners. In comparison, ITC had recorded a profit of ₹5,335 crore in the same period last year. ITC Q3 Results LIVE: The hotels segment delivered an impressive performance this quarter, generating ₹922 crore in revenue, marking a 15% year-on-year growth despite a strong base. Profit before tax reached ₹302 crore, reflecting a 43% increase from the previous year. Effective January 1, 2025, the hotels business was demerged into ITC Hotels. EBITDA margins improved by 450 basis points year-on-year, driven by higher RevPAR, operational efficiencies, and strategic cost management efforts. ITC Q3 Results LIVE: By segment, the cigarette business recorded an 8% increase in revenue, while profit before tax (PBT) grew by 4% year-on-year. The company continued implementing strategic portfolio adjustments and market initiatives, emphasizing competitive regions and tackling illicit trade to drive volume-led growth and strengthen its market position. A sharp rise in leaf tobacco costs was partially offset through an improved product mix, strategic pricing adjustments, and targeted cost management efforts. Additionally, trade marketing expenditures were restructured in the third quarter to enhance last-mile execution. ITC Q3 Results LIVE: The cigarette-to hotel conglomerate's EBITDA for the third quarter rose 3% YoY and ex-paper, the same increased 5% YoY. ITC Q3 Results LIVE: The company has set Wednesday, February 12th, as the Record Date for the purpose of determining entitlement of the Members for such Interim Dividend. ITC Q3 Results LIVE: The Board has also recommended an interim dividend of ₹6.5 per share for the financial year ended March 2025. ITC Q3 Results LIVE: Revenue from operations of the FMCG major increased 8% YoY to ₹20,350 crore. ITC Q3 Results LIVE: FMCG major ITC posted 7 per cent fall in its consolidated net profit to ₹4,935 crore for the quarter ending on December 31, 2024. ITC Q3 Results LIVE: According to Axis Securities, important aspects to monitor include the demand trends in rural and urban areas, competitive landscape, raw material expenses, and the future prospects of the hotels and agriculture sectors. ITC Q3 Results LIVE: The FMCG segment is expected to grow 5% YoY, while the hotels business may see a 15% increase. Paper and agri segments are projected to expand by 2% and 5% YoY, respectively, says Axis Securities. ITC Q3 Results LIVE: ""We expect 7% YoY sales growth in cigarette business and 5% YoY sales growth in FMCG business. We expect 6% YoY growth in cigarette EBIT with 70bp decline in margins due to rise in leaf tobacco prices. In the FMCG business, we expect 3% de-growth in EBIT with 60bp decline in margins as price hike lags RM inflation. The paper segment remained weak, while the agriculture segment and hotel business performed well during the quarter,"" the brokerage firm said. ITC Q3 Results LIVE: “We project an 8% year-over-year increase in both revenue and EBITDA. Cigarette volume is expected to rise by 3.5% compared to last year, although margins will be slightly squeezed due to rising raw material costs. Overall, we forecast net revenue and EBIT growth of 7.5% and 5.5% year-over-year, respectively.” ITC Q3 Results LIVE: Kotak Institutional Equities estimates ITC cigarette volume growth at ~3.5% YoY, translating into 7.5% growth in gross cigarette sales. It expects cigarette EBIT growth at 5% YoY, with 145 bps YoY decline in EBIT margin, due to some inflation in leaf tobacco and other inputs. ITC Q3 Results LIVE: Emkay Global sees ITC as relatively better placed in its FMCG coverage, where its diversified businesses will help negate any sharp slowdown in its segment. Cigarettes business volume growth has been positive and is likely to get support from steady contraction in informal supplies. Other FMCG is likely to be stressed in the near-term amid inflationary and demand stress. Given high inclination toward foods and beverages, we see inflationary stress to hurt margin delivery. Agri remains an opportunistic business, where we remain positive on long term value-add opportunities. Paper remains an area of concern, as the business is still under pressure, Emkay Global said. Emkay Global cuts its earnings estimates by ~2% each over FY25-27E. It maintained an ‘Add’ rating given limited upside potential, on ITC shares and has an unchanged target price of ₹520 per share. In the last six months, ITC’s stock price has performed relatively better versus FMCG peers. ITC Q3 Results LIVE: ITC Q3FY25 core net profit is estimated to fall 3% YoY to ₹4,942 crore, while revenue growth is seen at 8% YoY to ₹17,794 crore, according to Nuvama Equities. EBITDA may fall 4% YoY to ₹6,086 crore, whereas EBITDA margin is estimated to decline 235 bps YoY to 34.2%. Nuvama reckons adjusted PAT shall decrease 11% YoY due to higher other income and lower tax rate (17%) in the base. ITC Q3 Results LIVE: ITC’s Agri sales are likely to grow 20% YoY due to higher tobacco sales, while profit shall expand 12%. Leaf tobacco has experienced 20% inflation YoY, which is beneficial for ITC along with liberalisation of government exports in other commodities. Paper business is estimated to see 2% YoY sales growth, but 22% YoY dip in profits due to lack of operating leverage and high competition from imports, according to Nuvama Equities’ estimates. ITC Q3 Results LIVE: ITC Hotels business sales are likely to grow 16% YoY in Q3FY25, aided by strong wedding and ongoing holiday season with profits likely to surge 27%. ITC Hotels demerger effective date was January 1 2025. ITC Q3 Results LIVE: ITC’s FMCG segment is estimated to report weak sales and profit numbers during the December quarter. The segment’s sales are expected to grow 3% YoY, but EBITDA margins are likely to decline due to sharp raw material inflation in palm oil, maida and negative pricing in notebooks. ITC has not undertaken short-term measures such as cutting A&P, Nuvama Equities said. ITC Q3 Results LIVE: Brokerage firm Nuvama Institutional Equities expects ITC’s revenue and EBITDA to grow 8% and 1% YoY. It expects Cigarette volumes to grow 3.5% YoY and post a slight compression in margins due to raw material inflation. It anticipates net revenue and EBIT to grow 7.5% and 5.5% YoY. ITC Q3 Results LIVE: ITC’s Q3FY25 net profit is expected to fall 0.9% YoY to ₹5,290 crore, while its revenue may rise 6.7% YoY to ₹19,220 crore. EBITDA growth is seen at 4.8% YoY at ₹6,820 crore, while EBITDA margin is expected to contract to 35.5%, according to estimates by Motilal Oswal. ITC Q3 Results LIVE: ITC share price has remained subdued in the past one year without delivering any significant returns. It hit a 52-week high of ₹500.01 apiece on September 27, 2024, and touched a 52-week low of ₹377.74 apiece on March 12, 2024. ITC shares have fallen 3.5% year-to-date (YTD), and 3.7% in the past six months. ITC stock has gained over 8% in one year. However, in the past two years, ITC shares have rallied 22% and have given 100% returns in three years. ITC Q3 Results LIVE: MOFSL expects 6% YoY growth in cigarette EBIT with 70 bps decline in margins due to rise in leaf tobacco prices. In the FMCG business, it expects 3% de-growth in EBIT with 60 bps decline in margins as price hike lags raw material inflation. The paper segment remained weak, while the agriculture segment and hotel business performed well during the quarter. ITC Q3 Results LIVE: Motilal Oswal expects ITC’s cigarette business to show stable volumes and pricing, with the portfolio continuing to grow, aided by improvements in product mix. It models ~4% volume growth in the business in Q3FY25. It expects 7% YoY sales growth in cigarette business and 5% YoY sales growth in FMCG business. ITC Q3 Results LIVE: Axis Securities expects ITC to report 9% YoY revenue growth. This would be driven by Cigarette business growth 6% YoY with 3% volume growth.

The company’s revenue in the December quarter is expected to rise 8.6% to ₹17,713 crore from ₹16,314 crore, YoY. EBITDA is estimated to grow 3.4% to ₹6,231 crore from ₹6,024 crore, while EBITDA margin may contract by 175 bps to 35.2% from 36.9%, YoY, according to estimates by Axis Securities. ITC Q3 Results LIVE: ITC’s cigarettes and FMCG segments are estimated to show a decent growth, while growth in agri and paperboards is expected to remain subdued, analysts said. ITC Q3 Results LIVE: Analysts expect the diversified cigarette-to-FMCG conglomerate ITC to report a high-single digit revenue growth and fall in net profit on a year-on-year (YoY) basis. PAT may fall due to a low effective tax rate in Q3FY24. ITC Q3 Results LIVE: ITC share price traded lower ahead of the announcement of Q3 results today. ITC share price opened at ₹450.10 apiece on the BSE as against its previous close of Rs 448.25 per share. However, ITC stock price fell 1.04% to ₹443.55 apiece.

JSW Steel,"JSW Steel, Vedanta, Tata Steel and other metal stocks drop up to 2% as Trump doubles tariffs to 50%",https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/jsw-steel-vedanta-tata-steel-and-other-metal-stocks-drop-up-to-2-as-trump-doubles-tariffs-on-imports-to-25-11748838266504.html,"Indian metal stocks started June on a sombre note, with the Nifty Metal index declining 1.6% in early trade on Monday, June 2. Fourteen out of fifteen constituents opened in the red, trading with cuts of up to 2%. Lloyds Metals & Energy, JSW Steel, Welspun Corp, Vedanta, Tata Steel and Steel Authority of India emerged as the top laggards. While it’s not just metal counters facing selling pressure on Dalal Street today, the red wave swept across the board as global trade tensions resurfaced, triggering risk-off sentiment among investors. US President Donald Trump last week intensified trade tensions, announcing he would double tariffs on steel and aluminum imports and accusing China of violating a prior agreement to ease tariffs. Speaking at a rally in Pennsylvania, Trump said the US would raise steel tariffs from 25% to 50% starting next week while highlighting the partnership between Japan’s Nippon Steel and US Steel. Later, taking to his Truth Social account, Trump wrote, “It is my great honor to raise the tariffs on steel and aluminium from 25% to 50%, effective Wednesday, June 4th. Our steel and aluminum industries are coming back like never before. This will be yet another BIG jolt of great news for our wonderful steel and aluminum workers. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!” The announcement comes amid an ongoing legal battle over the legality of some of Trump’s tariff policies. An appeals court has allowed the case to proceed after the Court of International Trade ordered a halt to the taxes. Trump accused China of violating a tariff truce reached in early May—a claim Beijing rejected, countering with accusations of US wrongdoing. China, the world’s largest steel producer and exporter, has seen its steel exports to the US decline significantly since the 25% tariff was imposed in 2018. While India's exports of steel and aluminium to the US are limited, the drop in metal stocks occurred amid growing concerns that a potential rise in tariffs could impact global metal demand. A call between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping is expected later this week in a possible effort to ease trade tensions. On the economic front, Chinese factory activity data contracted at a slower pace in May than the month prior, also aiding the selling pressure in metal stocks today. As tariff headlines once again dominate global markets, Asian indices opened in the red on Monday, with the Nifty 50 and Sensex falling nearly 1% in early trade. Rising geopolitical tensions between Ukraine and Russia also pushed investors toward safe-haven assets, leading to a sharp decline in equities. According to Dr VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, the market structure currently supports a continuation of the ongoing consolidation phase. He noted that global headwinds—particularly renewed tariff concerns—are likely to restrain any breakout rally. However, strong domestic tailwinds may offer support at lower levels. He added that the recent announcement of 50% tariffs on steel and aluminium by President Trump signals ongoing uncertainty in the global trade environment, which may act as a significant headwind for markets. On the domestic front, however, factors such as better-than-expected Q4 GDP growth at 7.4%, improving trends in consumption and capital expenditure, low inflation, and the prospect of continued rate cuts present a solid foundation for sustained economic growth in FY26. The only near-term challenge, he pointed out, is weak earnings growth. If leading indicators begin to reflect a recovery, the market has a strong chance of breaking out of its current range and moving higher.

Tata Steel share price that opened at ₹151.20 on the BSE on Wednesday, slightly higher than the previous days closing price of ₹149.50, continued to rise further. The Tata Steel share price rose to intraday high of ₹157.15, which translated in gains of around 4.5% for the Tata Steel share price. SAIL or Steel Authority of India Ltd share price also after opening slightly higher at ₹116.85, compared to previous close of ₹116.05 , gained further. The SAIL share price gained up to ₹120.75 during the intraday trades and this meant rise of up to 4%. Jindal Steel and Power Ltd or JSPL share price and JSW steel share price also gained up to 2-3% during the morning trades on Wednesday. Tata Steel share price led the gains for the Nifty Metal Index that also saw intraday highs of 9,085.05, which meant gains of 2.8% for the metals index. Nifty metals index while was rising led by contribution from steel stocks most other metal stocks including those of NALCO and Hindalco Industries Ltd, too gained up to more than 4% The rise in steel and other metal stocks while is attributed to positive developments on the US China Tariff talks , India also has taken a firm stand on the Tariffs imposed by the US on metal imports from India According to a PTI report, India has proposed to impose retaliatory taxes on the United States in response to President Donald Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs, and it has submitted this plan to the World Trade Organization (WTO). The news reports suggest that the safeguards measures would have an impact on $7.6 billion worth of relevant product imports from India into the US, with $1.91 billion in duty revenue collected. India as per news reports argues that the US's actions are in violation of the 1994 General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATT) and the Agreement on Safeguards (AoS) and also that India reserves the right to suspend concessions or other obligations that are substantially equivalent to the adverse effects of the measure to India's trade Meanwhile as India and the US are still to resolve the abovesaid issue on tariff, the positive developments in China -US trade and tariff talks is encouraging. China is the largest producer and consumer of commodities and thereby influences the international prices of commodities. Hence resolution and positive developments on US -China tariff discussions is a big positive for Steel and metal producers in India too Disclaimer: The views and recommendations made above are those of individual analysts or broking companies, and not of Mint.

Kotak Mahindra Bank,"Kotak Mahindra Bank shares dive 7% as Q2 earnings disappoint, analysts cut target price
",https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/kotak-mahindra-bank-shares-dive-7-as-q2-earnings-disappoint-analysts-cut-target-price-11729487651969.html,"Shares of Kotak Mahindra Bank, one of India's leading private sector banks, fell 7.2% to ₹1,735 apiece during intraday trading on Monday, October 21. This decline followed the release of the bank's September quarter numbers (Q2FY25), which missed Street estimates and prompted some brokerage firms to lower their target prices on the stock. Global brokerage firm Phillip Capital downgraded the rating on the stock from 'buy' to ‘neutral’ and reduced its target price from ₹2,010 to ₹1,940. It said the bank is experiencing stress in its unsecured portfolio, which it expects to continue for several more quarters. It believes Kotak Mahindra Bank will be most affected by margin declines during the interest rate reversal phase, forecasting muted earnings growth due to pressure on net interest margins (NIM) and elevated credit costs. Systematix Institutional Equities also revised its target price for the stock, lowering it from ₹2,090 to ₹2,010 while maintaining a 'buy' rating. It estimates credit costs in the credit card, microfinance institution (MFI), and other portfolios to be 4%, 5%, and 0.4% for FY26, and 4%, 3%, and 0.4% for FY27, respectively, leading to earnings cut of approximately 5% for FY25-27. It values the standalone bank at 2.3x (down from 2.4x) the September 2026 price-to-adjusted book value (P/ABV), expecting an average return on assets (RoA) and return on equity (RoE) of 2.1% and 13.2%, compared to earlier projections of 2.2% and 13.5%. Investec has maintained its 'buy' rating on the stock but has reduced its target price from ₹2,300 to ₹2,185. Meanwhile, Motilal Oswal continues to hold its ""neutral"" rating with a target price of ₹1,950. It noted that the bank is navigating the limitations imposed by regulators effectively, and the potential lifting of the ban would further enhance its operating performance. Goldman Sachs retains its positive outlook on the stock, maintaining a 'buy' rating for a target price of ₹2,286 apiece. The bank reported a lower-than-expected 5% increase in profit for the July-September period at ₹3,344 crore, affected by higher loan provisions and shrinking lending margins. Provisions and contingencies, which are funds allocated for potential bad loans, surged nearly 80% to ₹660 crore during the quarter. Net Interest Income (NII) met expectations at ₹7,020 crore, reflecting an 11.5% year-over-year increase. However, the Net Interest Margin (NIM) declined to 4.9%, down 11 basis points quarter-over-quarter, due to a reduced share of higher-yielding unsecured loans, the full-quarter impact of regulatory constraints, and increased slippages. Analysts noted that the RBI's sanctions on credit card issuance and new customer onboarding via digital channels have negatively impacted the growth of high-yielding unsecured assets. They expect the pressure on NIM to continue, driven by moderate growth in the unsecured segment and the effects of deposit re-pricing. On the asset quality front, the Gross Non-Performing Assets (GNPA) ratio increased to 1.49%, up 10 basis points quarter-over-quarter, while the Net Non-Performing Assets (NNPA) ratio rose by 8 basis points to 0.43%. Slippages for the quarter came in at ₹1870 crore, reflecting a ratio of 1.92% compared to 1.44% in Q1. Restructured loans stood at 0.06%, amounting to ₹240 crore. Meanwhile, the bank entered into an agreement to acquire the personal loan book of Standard Chartered Bank ( ₹4100 crore) to further fortify its position in the retail credit market. The acquisition is likely to be completed in the next three months, subject to regulatory/other approvals.

However, its net interest income (NII) surged 14% YoY to Rs 4,902 crore.The bank’s PAT was reported at Rs 339 crore for Q3 FY25, compared to Rs 716 crore for the year-ago period.The bank's Net Interest Margin (NIM) for Q3 FY25 stood at 6.04%, down from 6.18% in Q2 FY25, primarily due to a decline in the microfinance segment and an increased focus on the wholesale banking business.Regarding asset quality, IDFC First Bank's gross NPA ratio was 1.94% as of December 31, 2024, improving from 2.04% a year earlier, while the net NPA ratio dropped to 0.52% in Q3 FY25, compared to 0.68% in Q3 FY24. The lender reported that gross slippages, or the loans classified as non-performing for the first time, in the microfinance segment jumped nearly 49% on-quarter to Rs 437 crore.After the bank’s Q3 results, here’s what brokerages say:Live EventsJefferies: Buy | Target price: Rs 73Profit for Q3 FY25 declined by 53%, falling short of estimates, as slower topline growth and higher credit costs weighed on performance. The Microfinance Institution (MFI) segment continues to pressure earnings, with challenges expected to persist for the next 2-3 quarters, particularly as certain state governments plan to implement stricter collection norms.Nuvama: Hold | Target price: Rs 60IDFC First Bank reported stronger-than-expected credit quality in Q3 FY25, with slippage up just 8% QoQ versus the estimated 15%, and non-MFI slippage remaining flat, outperforming peers. MFI slippage rose 49% QoQ, but the bank did not use the MFI contingency buffer during the quarter.While asset quality was a positive, PPOP missed expectations. Core PPOP declined 7% QoQ but grew 15% YoY, impacted by MFI reversals and an 8% QoQ rise in operating expenses. Credit costs and slippage remained elevated due to MFI stress, which may peak in Q4 FY25E.Centrum Broking: Reduce | Target price: Rs 61IDFC First Bank continues to perform well in advances and deposits, outpacing peers in attracting low-cost deposits. However, challenges remain with high operating expenses and elevated credit costs, expected to improve only by FY27. The bank's ambitious RoE target remains out of reach, with Q3 FY25 RoE at 3.6%, falling short of FY24 levels. Consequently, Centrum has slightly lowered FY25 estimates, with RoE expected to exceed the cost of equity only by FY27. Given the weaker macroeconomic outlook and delays in meeting return targets, the broking firm maintained a ‘reduce’ rating on the stock.(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views, and opinions given by the experts are their own.

IDFC First Bank,Another merger in focus! IDFC First Bank shares climb 2%; IDFC hits fresh one-year high. Analyst views,https://www.businesstoday.in/markets/company-stock/story/another-merger-in-focus-idfc-first-bank-shares-climb-2-idfc-hits-fresh-one-year-high-analyst-views-388361-2023-07-05,"Shares of IDFC First Bank rose on Wednesday after the private lender said its advances grew by 24.50 per cent on a year-on-year (YoY) basis and 6.70 per cent sequentially (quarter-on-quarter) in the June quarter 2023-24 (Q1 FY24). The stock today climbed 2.14 per cent to close at Rs 80.33. At today's closing price, the scrip is 4.96 per cent away from its 52-week high price of Rs 84.52, a level seen on June 19, 2023. Non-banking lender IDFC also gained today as the stock settled 2.79 per cent higher, at Rs 114.30, after touching a fresh 52-week high of Rs 116.85. Both the companies recently approved a ""long-pending"" merger aimed at simplifying their corporate structure and easing regulatory compliance. The announcement came on the heels of HDFC-HDFC Bank mega merger. As part of the deal, IDFC's shareholders would get 155 shares of IDFC First Bank for each set of 100 shares they currently own in the former. IDFC held a 39.93 per cent stake in the banking arm (IDFC First Bank) through IDFC Financial Holdings. ""This was a long-pending merger which was stuck due to the complex legal structure of IDFC and hence, took time to unwind,"" Asutosh Mishra, Analyst at Ashika Stock Broking, told news agency Reuters. Private lender IDFC First today said its loans and advances grew from Rs 1,37,663 crore, as of June 30, 2022, to Rs 1,71,420 crore, as of June 30, 2023, YoY growth of 24.50 per cent. The QoQ growth was 6.70 per cent. ""Customer deposits grew from Rs 1,02,868 crore, as of June 30 2022, to Rs 1,48,508 crore, as of June 30, 2023, YoY growth of 44.40 per cent. The QoQ growth was 8.60 per cent,"" IDFC First Bank stated. On technical setup, analysts remained mixed on the counter. Support level for IDFC First Bank could be seen at Rs 75. ""IDFC First Bank is trading close to its 52-week highs, and the broader structure of the stock looks strong. The stock has strong momentum in the short term as it finds buying emergence around its 21-DEMA. Hence, the stock remains strong and is likely to attract more buying once it takes out its one-year high of Rs 84.50, the probability of which is strong. As far as levels are concerned, the stock has resistance across its higher trading zone of 82-85 and is likely to find support in the 74-72 zone in the comparable period,"" Osho Krishan, Senior Analyst, Technical & Derivative Research at Angel One ""Since last 3 months, the counter has already given 58 per cent return. Though, it looks lucrative now due to its recent up move. But one needs to be cautious since it is trading near its historical high of the Rs 83-85 zone. Additionally, on a daily scale, there is a negative divergence on RSI daily, echoing towards some profit booking in the coming few sessions. As of now wait and watch no fresh longs are recommended,"" said Jigar S Patel, Senior Manager - Technical Research Analyst at Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers. ""IDFC First Bank is slightly bearish on the daily charts with strong resistance at Rs 85. A daily close below support of Rs 75 could lead to target of 67 in the near term,"" said AR Ramachandran from Tips2trades. Meanwhile, Indian equity benchmarks settled almost flat today. The 30-share BSE Sensex pack fell 33 points or 0.05 per cent to settle at 65,446.04, while the broader NSE Nifty index added 10 points or 0.05 per cent to settle at a fresh closing peak of 19,399.

In the same period last year, the Auto major had declared a profit of ₹2,042 crore. Jefferies India Private Ltd post Q3 results said that Bajaj auto reported a Modest Growth but In-line Q3 earnings performance Bajaj's Q3 Earnings Before Interest, tax, Deprecation and Amortisation (Ebitda0 and net profit rose just 3-6% YoY, although were in line with Jefferies Estimates. Bajaj expects 6-8% growth for motorcycle industry, and sees a strong 20%+ growth in exports in the near term. Jefferies analysts remain positive on growth outlook for both domestic and export two wheelers and expect 12% volume and 14% Earnings per share annual growth (CAGR) for Bajaj over FY25-27 estimated. Jefferies has fine-tuned estimates and retain their Buy ratings, although they said prefer Eicher Motors and TVS Motor Company Ltd within the two wheelers space. Bajaj Auto reported a decent quarterly performance, which was largely anticipated by the market, given the decline in domestic twowheeler sales during the quarter and slugged production, said Sagar Shetty, Research Analyst, StoxBox. The buoyancy in the topline was supported by three wheelers volumes and increased export contribution; however, a weaker product mix was the main pressure point during the three-month period, said Shetty. An improved Average Selling Price , with a 6% YoY growth, was one of the key pillars that enabled the company to help maintain its operational margins as per Shetty. The benefits of premiumisation largely reflected its products like Speed 400 and Duke 200/250, clocking in the highest-ever retail sales, with the expansion of its touchpoints boding well for the company. The company also experienced a five-fold surge in its e3W volumes, with market share expanding to a new quarter high (3x YoY), supported by an extended network from 600 to over 850 touchpoints. Chetak maintained its robust momentum, with volumes growing by ~2.5x YoY and an exit market share of 25% (+1100 bps). The company had mentioned improvement in its margin structure in the previous quarter’s concall, which was expected to materialize post the launch of the upgraded Chetak in November, said Shetty. Follow-up on the commentary would be key to gauge the profitability of its Electric Vehicles portfolio. Moving forward, management's comments on the CNG portfolio pipeline, production expansion plans, and margin improvement guidance will be key areas to watch, said Shetty Disclaimer: The views and recommendations above are those of individual analysts, experts, and brokerage firms, not Mint.

The overall market breadth was neutral as 1,540 shares were advancing while 1,423 were declining on the BSE. | Image: Shutterstock The Indian equity benchmarks edged lower on Friday, May 30, as gains in index heavyweights like Larsen & Toubro, Bank, Axis Bank, Adani Ports and Sun Pharma were offset with losses in Bajaj Auto, Infosys, Tech Mahindra, HCL Technologies and Tata Consultancy Services amid weak cues from Asian markets.

Strong motorcycle exports and forex gains helped offset weak domestic demand. The firm's revenue rose 6 percent to Rs 12,148 crore in Q4FY25 as compared to Rs 11,485 crore in Q4FY24, ""driven by double-digit revenue growth on premium motorcycles, electric scooters and commercial vehicles, and another solid volume-led exports performance"". Revenue missed double-digit growth due to the temporary suspension of KTM exports, it said. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates The two-wheeler major also said that the motorcycle market is set to clock 5-7 percent growth in FY26, and the 125cc and EV segments remain crucial. The 125cc category, which now contributes over half of all industry volumes, is expected to grow at nearly twice the pace of the overall market. The management said the e-scooter segment is likely to grow between 20 to 25 percent in FY26. Bajaj’s own Chetak electric scooter ended FY25 on a high note, emerging as the top-selling EV in the March quarter, adding to the company’s confidence in the segment’s prospects. Should you buy, sell, or hold the Bajaj Auto stock? Bernstein has maintained an ‘Outperform’ rating on Bajaj Auto with a target price of Rs 11,000 per share, an upside potential of 24 percent from the last close. The brokerage highlighted the company’s ability to sustain margins irrespective of the operating environment. It noted that the management communicated a positive outlook, particularly for exports. Despite challenges like the suspension of KTM exports, Bajaj Auto delivered a respectable Q4 with stable margins, it added. CLSA also retained its ‘Outperform’ rating with a target of Rs 10,149 per share. The company gained 12 percent year-on-year market share in the electric two-wheeler segment, reaching 25 percent in Q4, driven by the launch of a more affordable model. CLSA is building in a 7 percent volume growth in domestic two-wheelers and 12 percent in exports for FY26. On the flipside, Jefferies has a ‘Hold’ rating on the stock with a target of Rs 8,000 per share, lower than the last closing price of Rs 8,874. While Jefferies remains positive on the company’s growth prospects in both domestic and export two-wheeler segments and appreciates its expanding EV portfolio, it flagged concerns over the decline in market share in domestic motorcycles and India’s two-wheeler exports. It expects a 13 percent EPS CAGR over FY25–28 but noted that the stock’s 26x FY26 P/E valuation is expensive. The Pune-headquartered company's share price closed at Rs 8,874, higher by 0.3 percent from the last close on the NSE. Bajaj Auto has risen 13 percent in the last three months.

US President Trump on May 25 announced that he has postponed the imposition of 50 percent tariffs on European Union imports until July 9, after a phone call with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. ""We had a very nice call and I agreed to move it,"" Trump told reporters. The announcement came after Trump threatened to impose a 50 percent tariff on EU products starting June 1, 2025, accusing the block of systematically exploiting the United States through unfair trade practices. Trump had announced a 25 percent tariff on automobile imports into the US in April, and later signed an executive order for some tariff relief, blending tax credits and waivers covering up to 15 percent of the value of vehicles assembled domestically. The early onset of monsoon, which has hit multiple parts of South India has also added to the sentiment. The Centre expects above normal monsoon conditions to provide a significant boost to consumption and productivity in the upcoming financial year, reinforcing confidence in India’s growth momentum, senior government sources told Moneycontrol. Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) and Bajaj Auto shares were the top gainers on the index, rising over 2 percent to close at Rs 3,075 apiece and Rs 8,950 apiece respectively. MRF and Tata Motors shares gained over 1.5 percent each, while Samvardhana Motherson and Hero MotoCorp shares jumped over 1 percent each. Eicher Motors and Bharat Forge ended the session in the green with marginal gains. Despite the uptrend in the market, Maruti Suzuki and TVS Motor shares closed in the red with marginal losses. Balkrishna Industries shares tumbled over 6 percent after the company reported a sharp 25 percent decline in standalone net profit for the March quarter and laid out an aggressive capex plan to diversify into competitive tyre segments.

Eicher Motors,"Eicher Motors posts Q4 beat amid strong volumes; should you buy, sell, or hold?
",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/eicher-motors-posts-q4-beat-amid-strong-volumes-should-you-buy-sell-or-hold-13025963.html,"Royal Enfield-maker Eicher Motors Ltd. shares will be in focus in trade on Thursday, May 15, after the auto player reported higher-than-expected net profit for the quarter ended March 31, 2025. The auto player reported a net profit of Rs 1,362 crore for the fourth quarter of FY25, marking a rise of nearly 27 percent from the Rs 1,070 crore net profit reported in Q4 FY24. The firm's revenue from operations meanwhile rose 23 percent on-year to Rs 5,150 crore. Eicher Motors is confident of accelerating growth both in India and overseas, riding on product pipeline, premiumisation trends and sustained brand-building efforts. The company, which recently crossed the selling of one million motorcycles in a year — a tenfold jump from about 100,000 units a decade ago — is betting on the middleweight segment to fuel its expansion. It holds an 88 percent market share in this category in India and continues to double down on it with upcoming launches and refreshes lined up through the year. “Premiumisation is continuing,” the management said in a post-earnings call, adding that marketing investments and activations are helping grow the segment. The company expects domestic momentum to remain healthy, especially with signs of a revival in urban markets thanks to income tax cuts, while rural demand continues to be strong. Should you buy, sell, or hold shares of Eicher Motors? ""Eicher Motors maintains focus on absolute profitability growth. We expect Royal Enfield to continue outperforming peers, on strong product actions, with near-term margin pressure to be addressed once operating leverage kicks in,"" said Emkay Global, maintaining its target price of Rs 6,300, with a 'buy' rating. Royal Enfield’s domestic volumes increased 24 percent YoY in Q4FY25 (versus 3 percent growth for the motorcycle segment). Nuvama Institutional Equities expects industry-beating 10 percent CAGR over FY25–27. Meanwhile, exports are likely to grow at a 17 percent CAGR. ""In all, given increased focus on key models and launch of new products, we forecast a revenue CAGR of 13 percent over FY25–27E,"" said the brokerage after reissuing its 'buy' rating, with an update share price target of Rs 6,200, up from Rs 6,100 earlier. International brokerage HSBC maintained a 'hold' rating on Eicher Motors with a target price of Rs 5,300 per share. The brokerage noted that Royal Enfield is on track to achieve its highest-ever volumes in FY26, as a result of acceleration in volume growth. However, this came at the cost of operating margins. HSBC said that the current estimates and valuations already reflect the volume uptick, while any improvement in margins could act as an upside risk. Jefferies, on the other hand, has a 'buy' call with a target of Rs 6,500 per share. It highlighted that Q4 EBITDA was in line and profit after tax beat estimates. Jefferies noted a pickup in Royal Enfield volumes since September, with the company pushing to drive demand.

BHEL's expenses, which have hurt its earnings in the past four quarters, increased 9% to 58.75 billion rupees, driven by a 9.4% rise in the cost of materials and services. Revenue from operations rose nearly 10% to 54.85 billion rupees in the quarter, owing to a 4% rise in revenue from the power segment. India's electricity generation hit record highs in the April-June quarter - peak summer in the country - as demand surged, boosting orders for power equipment. Revenue from its industrials business, which is its second-biggest segment, reported a 30% surge during the period. BHEL's rival firms, Tata Power and Siemens will report quarterly results next month.",negative
BHEL,"BHEL stock tumbles over 7% after Q4 results miss Street estimates; brokerages give 'sell' rating
",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/bhel-stock-tumbles-over-7-after-q4-results-miss-street-estimates-brokerages-give-sell-rating-12729279.html,"Shares of Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL) tumbled as much as 7.5 percent to Rs 295 apiece on May 22 after January-March quarter (Q4FY24) results missed Street expectations. Analysts at CLSA shared a 'sell' rating on BHEL, with a target price of Rs 189 per share, implying a downside of 36 percent from current levels. They believe that a surprise 26 percent year-on-year (YoY) decline in the company's Q4 profit was due to slow-moving orders. ""The company's backlog has grown by 44 percent YoY in Q4FY24 as thermal orders picked up but operationally, a flat execution led to another weak quarter. We believe that the future of company's thermal business looks bleak beyond FY30,"" the brokerage firm added. Morgan Stanley also shared a target below current market price, setting it at Rs 220 per share, which indicates a downside of 34 percent as Q4 earnings missed estimates. However, they maintained an 'equal-weight' rating on BHEL, seeing improving earnings visibility with strong orders and healthy project pipeline. BHEL's net profit fell 26 percent YoY to Rs 489 crore in Q4FY24, while revenue rose marginally by 0.4 percent YoY to Rs 8,260 crore. The company's EBITDA, also known as operational profit, dropped by 30.6 percent YoY to Rs 728 crore, whereas EBITDA margins squeezed by 400 basis points (bps) YoY to 8.8 percent. ALSO READ: BHEL Q4 net profit falls 25% to Rs 484 crore, declares dividend The PSU firm's board recommended a final dividend of Rs 0.25 per share for FY24. Going ahead, analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities believe that focus on execution would be key for BHEL. ""Against 1.3x YoY order backlog, the revenue growth guidance is a modest 10-15 percent YoY. A potential miss in execution would impact working capital. Moreover, BHEL may end up sharing part of the pricing gains from orders with its vendors, limiting case for margin uptick hereon,"" they cautioned, sharing a 'sell' rating on the counter, with a target price of Rs 75 per share. So far this year, shares of BHEL soared over 56 percent, outpacing benchmark Nifty 50 index that rose by 3 percent during the same period. BHEL had hit 52-week high of Rs 322 per share on May 21, 2024.

BHEL,"BHEL Q1 results: Net loss widens to Rs 211 crore, revenue rises 10%
",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/bhel-q1-results-net-loss-widens-to-rs-211-crore-revenue-rises-10-12783251.html,"Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd (BHEL) on July 31 said that its net loss for the quarter ended 30 June, 2024 widened to Rs 211 crore from Rs 205 crore. The company's losses widened despite a rise in its topline and a rise in demand for power equipment due to India's rising electricity generation. The country's electricity demand hit record highs in the April-June quarter. India met a record maximum power demand of 250 GW on May 30, led by a combined impact of weather-related loads and growing industrial and residential power consumption in these areas. Revenue from operations increased 9.6 percent to Rs 5,845 crore in the June quarter from Rs 5,003 crore in the same quarter last fiscal. The company restated figures from the previous year to reflect adjusted expenses of Rs 2330 crore, which included deferred tax and provisions and write-offs, according to an exchange filing. BHEL's expenses, which have hurt its earnings in the past four quarters, increased 9 percent to Rs 5875 crore, driven by a 9.4 percent rise in the cost of materials and services. The company's management on May 21, 2024 had said that it had won a number of order in 2021-22 and 2022-23 without raw material pass-through variation clauses which has led to its operating margins contracting. As of April 1, BHEL had an outstanding orderbook of around Rs 1,31,600 crores. Out of the total orderbook power sector orders made up Rs. 92,559 crores, and out of these Rs 92,000 Crore Rs 52,000 crore orders are received 2023-24, the BHEL's management had said. Transformer makers in India have been struggling to increase production due to several issues such as global supply chain hiccups, copper volatility, and raw material shortages. Electrical steel and copper are two crucial raw materials in a power transformer. Bushings, transformer oil, and insulation are other materials used. According to a recent report by Wood Mackenzie, the lead time for procuring transformers has steadily risen over the past two years, ranging from 120 to 210 weeks globally. Transformer prices have risen 60 percent to 80 percent on average since January 2020, driven by higher copper prices, which have increased more than 40 percent over the same period. Transformer makers have in the past few months called for government intervention to ease import policies for key raw materials that are in shortage in India. Indian transformer industries are operating at only 60 percent to 70 percent of their capacity. Furthermore, according to transformer companies, meeting short circuit criteria, as outlined by the Central Electricity Authority of India’s (CEA) guidelines, presents a challenge due to the diverse range of ratings and voltage classes selected by developers to optimize the overall costs. They added that although CEA has expanded its guidelines to accommodate these requirements, many solar developers insist on strict compliance, reducing the pool of available suppliers and exacerbating demand and lead times. BHEL's revenue from its industrials business, which is its second-biggest segment, reported a 30 percent surge during the period. Shares of BHEL on July 31 were trading 0.20 percent to Rs 316.70 apiece on BSE. Discover the latest Business News, Budget 2025 News, Sensex, and Nifty updates.

",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/godrej-consumer-products-stock-rises-as-jpmorgan-keeps-overweight-sees-23-upside-12890519.html,"Shares of FMCG major Godrej Consumer Products Limited gained over a percent to Rs 1,128 in morning trade on December 16 after JPMorgan maintained its 'overweight' call on the stock and raised the target price, suggesting that the company's long-term growth levers are still intact. With a price target of Rs 1,365, the international brokerage forecasts an upside potential of 23 percent from the last closing price of Rs 1,111 on the National Stock Exchange. The Godrej Consumer stock has tanked 10 percent in the past week and 25 percent in three months. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates The company’s CFO attributed 85–90 percent of the recent volume deceleration to cyclical factors, ruling out structural demand concerns, Jefferies said. Godrej Consumer expects its soaps segment to return to normative volume growth levels over the next two quarters. If seasonality trends remain normal in the upcoming fourth quarter, the company anticipates a quicker recovery in the first half of FY25. Following a sharp sell-off, JPMorgan finds the risk-reward balance more favourable and expects the company to outperform its peers in the coming months. Earlier this month, Godrej Consumer Products provided a subdued growth outlook for the October-December quarter, expecting sales to grow in the mid-single digits. The company noted that demand conditions in the economy have remained weak over the past few months. Adverse weather events, including a delayed winter in North India and a cyclone in the South, have weighed on the Home Insecticides segment, which contributes a third of its standalone business. Despite these challenges, the rest of the portfolio is performing well and is on track to deliver double-digit underlying volume growth. In Q2, the company reported a 13 percent rise in net profit at Rs 491 crore, higher than the Rs 433 crore reported in the same quarter the previous year. The company's revenue from operations rose 2 percent to Rs 3,666 crore in the second quarter.

It also has a presence in Indonesia, Africa, the United States (US) and the Middle East, among others. In Q3FY25, consolidated revenue increased 3.0% YoY to Rs. 3,768cr mainly owing to flat growth in underlying volume. Revenue from India increased 2.6% YoY to Rs. 2,262cr led by growth in the home care and personal care segments. The home care segment grew 4.0% YoY, driven by the strong performance of Goodknight Agarbatti, which gained significant market share in the incense sticks segment. However, lower demand for household insecticides and a slowdown in urban consumption affected premium formats. Personal care grew 2.0% YoY, despite personal wash volumes declining in the midto-high single digits, while hair colour volumes grew in the mid-single digits. EBITDA fell 16.4% YoY owing to a 7.3% YoY increase in employee benefit expenses, 6.1% YoY rise in selling, marketing and distribution expenses and 19.7% YoY growth in other expenses.

Godrej Consumer,"Godrej Consumer shares tank 9% after firm flags Q3 margin, volume growth warning",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/godrej-consumer-shares-tank-9-after-firm-flags-q3-margin-volume-growth-warning-12885694.html,"Godrej Consumer Products (GCPL) shares plunged over 9 percent in opening trade on December 9, weighed down by the company's weak growth outlook for the October-December quarter. The company anticipates sales growth in mid-single digit for Q3 while stating that demand conditions in the economy have been 'subdued' for the past few months. The company also anticipates a 'temporary downward breach' in the margin this quarter, from the normative range. Further adding to the pressure, the company said that it expects its standalone business to report around flattish UVG (Underlying Volume Growth) for the quarter under review. ""The demand conditions in India have been subdued for the past few months which is evident in FMCG market growth,"" said GCPL. Despite this, the company has over the past six quarters 'consistently delivered an average organic UVG of ~7 percent,' it added. Follow our market blog to catch all the live action The delayed onset of winter in the North and a cyclone in South India have impacted the Home Insecticides segment, which accounts for a third of the standalone business. Despite this, the rest of the portfolio is demonstrating strong performance and is on track to achieve double-digit UVG. Meanwhile, a high base of the previous fiscal, when the company enjoyed the benefits of favourable commodity prices which lifted its margins, is also likely to affect its on-year growth numbers. Despite the warnings, brokerages remain cautiously optimistic of the headwinds of slowdown subsiding soon. JPMorgan expressed optimism over the strong growth indicators for the rest of GCPL's portfolio while citing that these headwinds were not structural. While Jefferies does believe that the earlier-than-usual quarterly sales updates may add to investor concerns of an industry slowdown, it still expressed confidence over the management's outlook of margin impact being a transitory issue. UBS Securities also sided with GCPL, banking on the rest of the company's portfolio, which is expected to see double-digit volume growth. Along those lines, JPMorgan retained its 'overweight' call on GCPL, while UBS Securities and Jefferies held on to their respective 'buy' ratings on the stock.

Godrej Consumer,"Godrej Consumer Products bullish on demand revival amid easing inflation, tax cuts
",https://www.livemint.com/companies/company-results/godrej-consumer-products-bullish-on-demand-revival-amid-easing-inflation-tax-cuts-11746621320751.html,"New Delhi: Godrej Consumer Products Ltd (GCPL) is betting on easing food inflation, tax cuts, and upcoming pay commission hikes to revive consumer demand over the next 12 to 18 months, CEO Sudhir Sitapati said on Wednesday. Despite lingering headwinds in its core soaps business due to a surge in palm oil prices, the company expects demand to pick up as inflation stabilizes and the impact of government welfare schemes kicks in. For the March quarter, GCPL reported a 6% rise in consolidated volumes and a 6.2% increase in revenue to ₹3,597.95 crore. But the company's broader strategy hinges on a pivot to emerging categories like pet care, liquid detergents, and deodorants, where it sees higher growth potential even as its soaps segment remains under pressure. Read this | FMCG's mixed bag: Rural strength masks urban slump in latest quarter Sitapati expressed confidence in the outlook for FMCG demand, citing factors like reduced food inflation and the government's income tax cuts and welfare schemes. “We are bullish about consumer demand over the next 12 months for a variety of reasons. The El Nino effect basically took up food prices in India last year. Food price inflation has an immediate impact on FMCG consumption. Now that El Nino has reversed, food price inflation has come down in the January to March period,” he said. “We should see some kind of demand coming back,” he added. GCPL's performance in the March quarter reflects this cautious optimism. Its consolidated revenue from operations grew 6.2% to ₹3,597.95 crore, with a profit of ₹411.90 crore, compared to a ₹1,893.21 crore loss a year ago. For FY24, the company saw a 2% rise in revenue from operations, totaling ₹14,364.29 crore. However, the company acknowledged the persistent challenges posed by inflationary pressures, particularly the sharp rise in palm oil prices, which have affected its Ebitda margins. Sitapati referred to the inflationary spike as a ""short-term blip"" and defended the company's decision to limit price hikes, passing on only 15–16% of the palm oil price increase to consumers rather than shocking the market with higher prices. Looking ahead, GCPL is shifting focus toward high-growth, under-penetrated categories, even as the soaps business continues to feel the impact of rising input costs. The company sees significant growth opportunities in body wash, liquid detergents, deodorants, air fresheners, pet care, and sexual wellness. In 2023, GCPL acquired the fast-moving consumer goods business of Raymond Consumer Care Ltd (RCCL), adding brands like Park Avenue deodorants and KamaSutra sexual wellness products to its portfolio. In April 2024, the company launched its pet care brand, ‘Godrej Ninja,’ in Tamil Nadu, leveraging the group’s marketing and manufacturing strengths. Additionally, GCPL made a strong move in liquid detergents with the launch of Fab Liquid, priced at ₹99, which achieved an annualized revenue run rate of ₹250 crore within 12 months. The company is also introducing more affordable products in its deodorant range, including a ₹99 antiperspirant, Block, and a reduced-price KamaSutra deodorant. Another segment poised for growth is household insecticides. Read this | Q4 earnings watch: Consumption giants drive revenue but lag in profits GCPL’s brands, Goodknight and Hit, saw double-digit growth in the March quarter. The company is also expanding in the category with innovations like a patented molecule (RMF) in its electric and incense formats, aiming to disrupt the market for illegal incense sticks and drive product and consumer awareness. GCPL anticipates mid-to-high single-digit volume growth in FY26, with high-single-digit revenue growth and double-digit Ebitda growth for FY25. Also read | FMCG stocks are usually a good defensive bet. So why are they underperforming now? The company expects a recovery in profits once palm oil prices stabilize, which should help support margin expansion in the coming quarters. Sitapati remains optimistic that GCPL’s focus on the ""categories of tomorrow"" will help the company weather short-term challenges and position it for long-term success.

Godrej Consumer,"Godrej Consumer Products share price plunges 10% after weak mid-Q3 update; Should you buy the FMCG stock?
",https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/godrej-consumer-products-share-price-plunges-over-9-after-weak-mid-q3-update-should-you-buy-the-fmcg-stock-11733717305563.html,"Godrej Consumer Products share price plunged 10% in early trade on Monday after the FMCG company reported weak mid-quarter business update, highlighting demand headwinds. Godrej Consumer Products shares declined as much as 10% to ₹1,112.05 apiece on the BSE. “The demand conditions in India have been subdued for the past few months which is evident in FMCG market growth. Despite the demand conditions, GCPL has over the past six quarters consistently delivered an average organic UVG of ~7% on the back of category development supported by innovations and media investments,” Godrej Consumer Products said in its mid-Q3 business update. The surge in palm oil and derivatives prices to the extent of a YoY increase of 20-30% has impacted the soaps category, which represents 1/3rd of Godrej Consumer Products’ standalone business revenue. To partly offset the cost increases, the company said it has taken price increases, reduced grammage of key packs and reduced various trade schemes. “Such pricing actions typically have minimal impact on category consumption but do result in reduced inventory across wholesale and household pantry. Historical patterns indicate a normalization in volume growth following price stabilization, which we anticipate occurring in the next few months,” the company said. Moreover, the company also highlighted that unsupportive weather conditions have impacted the growth in its Home Insecticides segment, which contributes to 1/3rd of its standalone business. “The rest of the portfolio is demonstrating robust performance and expected to deliver double digit UVG. However, given the significant contribution of Soaps and HI to the overall business mix, the Standalone business is expected to report around flattish UVG and around mid-single digit sales growth in this quarter,” Godrej Consumer Products said. The current inflationary environment has created pressure on the margins and the company anticipates a temporary downward breach of the normative margins this quarter. Godrej Consumer Products expects its Indonesia business to deliver continued superior performance with mid-single digit volume growth and high single digit sales growth. In line with its earlier guidance, the GAUM (Godrej Africa, USA, and Middle East) organic business is expected to see volume decline due to reduction in trade stocks and portfolio simplification. “The effects of these actions would be largely completed in Q3 FY 25. However, we continue to do well on our profitability journey, and this is likely to be the fourth consecutive quarter of healthy EBITDA margins for GAUM,” it said. These are exceptional situations in Standalone business that the management believes are transitionary and not structural. Hence the management remains focused on navigating these near-term challenges while maintaining strategic investments for long-term growth as these negative trends are likely to persist for a few months, the company added. Factoring headwinds in Soaps and Home Insecticides during the quarter, Antique Stock Broking has cut its earnings estimates by 6%/ 6%/ 6% for FY25/ FY26/ FY27. It believes this weakness is transitionary in nature and the company should be able to recover its performance. The brokerage firm expects Godrej Consumer Products to deliver sales/ earnings CAGR of 9%/ 15% over FY24–27E driven by strong performance in Home Insecticides in India (product innovation) and improving profitability in GAUM business (post restructuring). Antique Stock Broking maintained a ‘Buy’ recommendation on Godrej Consumer Products shares and cut the target price to ₹1,512 per share from ₹1,605 earlier. Global brokerage JPMorgan maintained an ‘Overweight’ rating on Godrej Consumer Products shares with a target price of ₹1,410 apiece. It believes the company’s business update shows higher than anticipated revenue / earnings risk which are likely to further weigh on the share price performance in the short term. It expects price hikes would keep revenue growth at mid single-digit levels. At 9:40 AM, Godrej Consumer Products shares were trading 9.20% lower at ₹1,121.95 apiece on the BSE.

Godrej Consumer,India's Godrej Consumer slumps 9% after flagging weak Q3 demand,https://www.livemint.com/news/india/indias-godrej-consumer-slumps-9-after-flagging-weak-q3-demand-11733726725342.html,"Shares of India's Godrej Consumer Products slumped 9% on Monday, set for their worst day since March 2020 and dragging down its peers in the fast moving consumer goods sector after the firm warned of stress on demand and profit margins in the third quarter. The stock fell to its lowest since Jan. 18, its biggest one-day percentage drop since the onset of the pandemic. The decline dragged down the consumer goods index by 2.2%. The benchmark Nifty 50 was down about 0.1% on the day. Including Monday's decline, the consumer index has shed about 14% so far this quarter and is set for its worst ever quarterly performance as Indian consumer companies continue to feel the pinch of still-high inflation and a consequent fall in demand. Godrej Consumer said on Friday that two-thirds of its India business is under demand and margin stress due to higher raw material costs and unfavourable weather. The company's update will ""likely add to investor concerns"" on the consumer industry as a whole, which has been facing a slowdown, Jefferies said in a note. To partly offset higher costs in palm oil, a key ingredient for Godrej's soap business that contributes one-third to its standalone revenue, the company undertook measures including price increases during the quarter. ""Such pricing actions typically have minimal impact on category consumption but do result in reduced inventory across wholesale and household pantry,"" Godrej said. The warning by Godrej will also impact peers, Jefferies said, adding that recent analyst meetings with Hindustan Unilever and Colgate-Palmolive India have not provided confidence about a recovery in consumption.

Dr. Reddy’s Labs,Indian drugmaker Dr Reddy's shares slide after Q3 profit miss,https://www.livemint.com/companies/company-results/indian-drugmaker-dr-reddy-s-shares-slide-after-q3-profit-miss-11737699531283.html,"(Reuters) -Shares of Dr Reddy's Laboratories dropped 6% on Friday and were on track for their worst session in nearly nine months, after missing its third-quarter profit estimates on lower sales and pricing pressures in the key North American market. The generic drugmaker was the top loser on the Nifty Pharma index and the benchmark Nifty 50 index. The pharma index was down 1.1% and the Nifty was up 0.5%, as of 11:45 a.m. IST. [.BO] ""The drop in shares comes as market sees near-term concerns over the company's muted U.S. sales,"" said Sumit Gupta, analyst at Centrum Broking. Indian generic drugmakers are struggling with slower sales in the United States, delayed approvals for new drug applications and lower pricing amid stiff competition. Reddy's growth will remain tepid over the next two years due to its high dependence on its generic version of Revlimid, a popular cancer treatment drug by Bristol-Myers Squibb, said Kunal Lakhan, an analyst at CLSA said. On Thursday, the company flagged slower sales of the generic cancer drug, Lenalidomide, weighing on its North America business. The region contributes about 41% of Reddy's overall revenue. Analysts at Nuvama said in a note the drug's sales were ""nearing the cliff"" due to increased competition in the region. ""Investor attention is on how Dr. Reddy's offsets the gRevlimid impact on earnings,"" Nuvama analysts said. Nuvama cut its target price on stock to 1,533 rupees from 1,553 rupees earlier, it retained ""buy"" rating. Reddy's North America sales rose 1% on-year but dropped 9% sequentially in the quarter. The company's India sales, which boosted its overall revenue, reflected growth slowdown due to subdued sales in its gastro and cardio segments, Macquarie said in a note. At least four brokerages slashed price targets on the stock, while three cut their ratings, LSEG data showed.

Dr. Reddy’s Labs,Dr Reddy's share price jumps 4% on Nuvama's upgrade to buy; brokerage sees potential despite risks from Revlimid expiry,https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/dr-reddys-share-price-jumps-4-on-nuvamas-upgrade-to-buy-brokerage-sees-potential-despite-risks-from-revlimid-expiry-11736313901637.html,"Dr Reddy's share price jumped almost 4% during Wednesday’s trading session after Nuvama Institutional Equities, a brokerage firm, raised its rating on the stock from ‘Reduce’ to ‘Buy,’ setting a target price of ₹1,553. The brokerage is optimistic about the pharmaceutical company's proactive strategies to lessen the effects of the patent expiration for its blockbuster drug Revlimid in 2026. The brokerage noted that the expiration of the Revlimid patent in 2026 presents a considerable risk to Dr Reddy's earnings growth, as the medication accounts for approximately 40% of its FY24 EBITDA. The company is addressing this issue, and we can see that management has outlined strategies to lessen the effects of the Revlimid loss. “Dr Reddy's has prepared itself rather well for the Revlimid expiry via several initiatives, which should help it fend off about 80% of the expiry fallout on EBITDA. We have now incorporated its key products in our current forecasts and are raising FY27E earnings by 15%. We value the stock at 24x FY27E EPS, yielding a TP of ₹1,553/share. A favourable risk-reward forces our hand to upgrade Dr Reddy to ‘BUY’ (from ‘REDUCE’),” said the brokerage. On Wednesday, Dr Reddy's share price opened at ₹1,370.90 apiece on the BSE, the stock touched an intraday high of ₹1,404.60 per share and an intraday low of ₹1,361.55 apiece. Rajesh Bhosale, Equity Technical and Derivative Analyst at Angel One, said that Dr Reddy's share prices witnessed a sharp move during the opening hour as, after a gap up, prices went on to test beyond 1,400 levels. However, prices have erased some of the morning gains but still maintain the positive tone. Considering the higher top, higher bottom structure, we maintain a positive bias, with 1,420-1,450 as immediate resistance and 1,340 as strong support. Dr Reddy’s reported a 9.35% decrease in its consolidated net profit, amounting to ₹1,341.5 crore for the quarter ending September 2024. The pharmaceutical giant had recorded a net profit of ₹1,480 crore during the same period last year, as stated in a regulatory filing from the Hyderabad-based company. Nevertheless, its revenue grew by 16.51% to ₹8,016.2 crore in the September quarter, compared to ₹6,880.2 crore in the previous year’s quarter.

Dr. Reddy’s Labs,"Dr Reddy's Laboratories share price declines 6% post Q3 results: Should you buy, sell or hold?",https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/dr-reddys-laboratories-share-price-declines-6-post-q3-results-should-you-buy-sell-or-hold-11737691058272.html,"Stock Market Today: Dr Reddy's Laboratories share price declined more than 6% in the morning trades on Friday post-Q3 results that were announced after the market hours of Thursday. Dr Reddy's Laboratories share price opened at ₹1247.95 on the BSE on Friday, more than 3% lower than the previous day's closing price of ₹1289.35. Dr Reddy's Laboratories share price thereafter declined more than 6% to intraday lows of ₹1203.60. On Thursday, January 23, Dr Reddy's Laboratories reported that its consolidated profit after tax (PAT) for the quarter ended December 2024 (Q3) increased by 2% year-over-year (YoY) to ₹1,413.3 crore. Last year's third quarter PAT was ₹1,378.9 crore. There was some despoilment with the US sales growth as North American Generics sales grew only 1% YoY to ₹33,834 crore (down 9% sequentially) even though India and emerging markets sales grew 12-14% YoY. Jefferies India reacting to Dr Reddy's December quarter results said the weakness in core profitability shows an uptick in 3Q. Jefferies said Dr Reddy's 3Q underlying revenue growth moderated to 7.5% YoY, primarily due to flat US sales YoY. “Underlying EBITDA margins were also impacted, due to incremental competition in top products and high Selling General and Administrative costs. Dr Reddy's remains in an investment phase, with most catalysts likely to unfold in FY27 or beyond,” said Jefferies while lowering FY25-27 earnings per share estimate by 3-6%. Jefferies maintained ‘Underperform’ ratings with a revised price target of ₹1,170 on DRL stock. Analysts at JM Financials said US business reported tepid sales due to lower sales of generic Revlimid sales used to treat multiple myeloma and price erosion. However, despite lower Revlimid sales, EBITDA margins remained healthy at 27.5% in Q3, as per analysts. During the earnings call, the company reiterated its confidence in overcoming the generic Revlimid slump post-FY26 led by the Semaglutide opportunity in Canada & rest of the world as well as Abatacept from Jan'27. Margins are likely to be maintained at ~25% with flexibility on SG&A as well as R&D spending, according to JM Financial's estimates. JM Financial analysts believe the street is underappreciating the near-term Semaglutide opportunity in Canada as well as 18 other markets which are opening up from CY26. JM Financial post-Q3 maintained its estimates and BUY rating with a target price of ₹1,723.

The pharma firm reported 22 percent year-on-year increase in net profit, to reach Rs 1,594 crore. Its revenue for the quarter rose 8.6% YoY to Rs 8,506 crore.

The rally followed the company’s announcement of a strategic collaboration with Alvotech to co-develop, manufacture, and commercialize a biosimilar version of Keytruda (pembrolizumab) for global markets. Keytruda, a blockbuster immunotherapy drug used in the treatment of various cancers, generated global sales of $29.5 billion in 2024. The collaboration brings together the biosimilar expertise of both companies and is expected to accelerate development timelines while broadening the global reach of the product. As per the agreement, Dr. Reddy’s and Alvotech will jointly handle development, manufacturing, and commercialisation, with shared responsibilities and costs. Barring certain exceptions, both companies will also have the right to market the biosimilar in international markets. Adding to the stock’s momentum, HSBC upgraded Dr. Reddy’s to a ‘Buy’ from ‘Hold’, and raised its target price to Rs 1,445, up from Rs 1,235. In its note, HSBC said Semaglutide—a drug used for type-2 diabetes—is expected to significantly boost the company’s Earnings Per Share (EPS) within a year of its launch in key regions. The brokerage sees Canada, Brazil, and India as key target markets for Semaglutide, where demand remains strong but supply is currently constrained. Unlike typical generics, HSBC does not expect prices for Semaglutide to fall sharply due to sustained demand. It estimates that the Semaglutide opportunity could nearly triple in these markets over the next two to four years. In the past month, Dr. Reddy’s stock has gained 9 percent, significantly outperforming the 1 percent rise in the benchmark Nifty 50.

""Wherever (price increase) is absolutely essential, we will have to take some pricing action,"" Nestle India Managing Director Suresh Narayanan told Reuters in Mumbai on February 24, adding the price hike will be ‘as low as possible’.

The measures announced in the Union Budget to reduce personal income tax rates is expected to boost consumption, with its effects likely to be seen from the second half of the year.

Nestle India,"Nestle India Q4 Preview: Profit likely to sink 6% amid surging inflation, muted demand; margins under pressure",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/nestle-india-q4-preview-profit-likely-to-sink-6-amid-surging-inflation-lagging-urban-demand-margins-to-remain-pressured-13000913.html,"Maggi noodles maker Nestle India will showcase its earnings report for the fourth quarter of the previous fiscal year on April 24, 2025. For the quarter gone by, margins are likely to be under stress from high coffee and cocoa prices. Weak operational performance is also expected to drag the company's net profit. According to a Moneycontrol poll of 11 brokerages, Nestle India is likely to report a 4.4 percent year-on-year rise in revenue at Rs 5,500 crore compared to Rs 5,268 crore reported in the same quarter last year. Net profit for the January to March period is likely to fall nearly six percent to Rs 870 crore as against Rs 924 reported in the March quarter of the previous financial year. Earnings estimates of analysts polled by Moneycontrol are in a diverse range. While even the most optimistic estimate sees Nestle India’s net profit tumbling by half a percent, the most pessimistic suggests the net profit could crack 9.5 percent on-year. According to experts, increased competitive intensity in infant nutrition and downtrading in the coffee business to weigh on the revenue growth for the quarter. Volume Growth: Experts are pencilling in low single digit volume growth, between two and three percent, as lower urban demand continues to impact Nestle India's topline growth. However, analysts at Kotak say the volume growth will be partly buoyed by some benefit in Maggi portfolio due to Maha Kumbh 2025. Margins: EBITDA margin is likely to be under stress due to inflation in coffee, cocoa, wheat and vegetable oil, on a high base. However, the firm has undertaken some hikes in chocolates, coffee, and Maggi, which should lend some support. Demand weak: Overall demand trends, have improved sequentially given marginal recovery in urban - however slowdown still persists. ""As the urban slowdown tapers down (likely by Q2FY26) we estimate a demand trends to further improve from here on,"" said analysts at Nuvama Institutional Equities. Nestle India is seeing more of an impact from the lag in urban demand as a result of its urban-skewed portfolio mix. Sharp fall in PAT: Kotak explained the sharp decline in net profit could be as a result of lower other income. Nestle India's cash balance is likely to be lower, following its investment of Rs 700 crore in a joint venture with pharma giant Dr Reddy's. Analysts will closely monitor the management’s commentaries on demand and material costs. They will also pay attention to raw material prices and their effect on EBITDA margins, as well as the growing competitive pressure across segments.

",https://www.livemint.com/companies/company-results/nestle-india-q2-results-net-profit-rises-8-6-to-rs-986-crore-revenue-up-1-3-yoy-11729148358438.html,"Nestle India reported a standalone net profit of ₹986.4 crore for the second quarter of FY25, registering a rise of 8.6% from ₹908 crore in the same quarter last fiscal. The company’s revenue from operations in Q2FY25 increased marginally by 1.3% to ₹5,104 crore from ₹5,037 crore a year ago. At the operational level, earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) during the quarter ended September 2024 decreased 4.7% to ₹1,168 crore from ₹1,225 crore, while EBITDA margin weakened by 130 basis points (bps) to 22.9% from 24.2%, YoY. However, Nestle India’s consolidated net profit in Q2FY25 declined to ₹899 crore from ₹908 crore in the corresponding quarter of the previous year. “Despite a challenging external environment with muted consumer demand and high commodity prices especially for coffee and cocoa, we remained resilient in our pursuit to deliver growth. This quarter, 5 of our top 12 brands grew at double-digit. However, some key brands witnessed pressure due to softer consumer demand and we focus on them and have in place robust action plans,” said Suresh Narayanan, Chairman and Managing Director of Nestlé India. He added that in the last 9 months, 65% of the company’s top 12 brands including MAGGI noodles showed positive volume growth. Nestle India’s beverages business posted double-digit growth backed by strong performance across NESCAFÉ CLASSIC, NESCAFÉ SUNRISE, and NESCAFÉ GOLD, which can be attributed to category recruitment and premiumization of coffee. MILKMAID also reported high double-digit growth. Masala-Ae-Magic continued to grow at a high double-digit. The toddlers’ range recorded high double-digit growth. KITKAT delivered high single digit growth. Amongst the newer categories, the petcare business demonstrated high single-digit growth, Narayanan added. The company’s Out-of-Home business saw strong double-digit growth. “Commodity prices remain elevated specially for coffee and cocoa, with prices of cereals and edible oils also being accentuated with recent developments. There is relative stability in milk prices and packaging so far,” Nestle India said in a release. At 2:30 pm, Nestle India shares were trading 2.93% lower at ₹2,390.00 apiece on the BSE.

Apollo Hospitals,"Apollo Hospitals shares surge 4% as board clears plan to list pharmacy, digital health business",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/apollo-hospitals-shares-in-focus-as-board-clears-plan-to-list-pharmacy-digital-health-business-13209471.html,"Shares of Apollo Hospitals Enterprises rallied as much as 4 percent to Rs 7,555 in today's session on July 1 after the company announced that its board approved the separate listing of its omni-channel pharmacy and digital health businesses within 18–21 months, as part of a broader reorganisation to unlock value. The board of Apollo Hospitals and its subsidiary Apollo HealthCo has granted in-principle approval for a composite scheme of arrangement aimed at reshaping its pharmacy and digital health business. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates Under the proposed scheme, Apollo will demerge its omni-channel pharmacy and digital health operations — including its telehealth vertical and investment in Apollo HealthCo Ltd (AHL) — into a new entity (NewCo). This will be followed by the merger of AHL into NewCo. Additionally, Keimed Pvt Ltd, one of India’s largest pharmaceutical wholesalers, will also be integrated into the new entity, creating a large-scale, end-to-end pharmacy distribution and digital healthcare platform. The new entity aims to clock Rs 25,000 crore in revenue by FY27. Apollo said NewCo will be classified as an Indian Owned and Controlled Company (IOCC) and is expected to be listed on Indian stock exchanges within 18–21 months, subject to regulatory approvals. As part of the plan, NewCo will acquire the remaining 74.5 percent stake in Apollo Medicals Pvt Ltd (AMPL), which owns 100 percent of Apollo Pharmacies Ltd (APL), consolidating control of its front-end pharmacy business. Post-restructuring, Apollo Hospitals Enterprise Ltd (AHEL) will retain a 15 percent stake in NewCo to ensure integration across the patient journey and healthcare continuum. Commenting on the development, Apollo Hospitals Group Chairman Dr. Prathap C. Reddy said the new structure will enable high-quality healthcare access to millions of Indians through a unique omni-channel model. Managing Director Suneeta Reddy highlighted that shareholders would benefit through direct ownership in what will become India’s largest pharmacy and digital health platform. Shobana Kamineni, Executive Chairperson of Apollo HealthCo, said the integration would create a customer-focused healthcare leader, delivering medicines through over 7,000 physical stores and an online platform covering 19,000 pincodes. Should you buy, sell or hold the stock? Morgan Stanley has maintained an overweight rating with a target price of Rs 8,058 per share, an upside potential of over 11 percent. The brokerage notes that Apollo currently trades at a discount to key peers due to its 24/7 business. Under the proposed structure, Apollo shareholders will receive 195.2 shares of NewCo for every 100 shares held in Apollo Hospitals. The international brokerage believes that if NewCo meets its aggressive revenue and EBITDA targets, it could unlock significant shareholder value. Citi has reiterated its buy call on Apollo Hospitals with a target price of Rs 8,260 per share. The firm views the plan to list the combined digital entity as a positive development. Like Morgan Stanley, the brokerage highlights that Apollo’s hospital business currently trades at a 25–30 percent discount compared to peers, primarily due to ongoing losses in the 24/7 segment and a complex corporate structure. With the spin-off and a more streamlined structure, Citi anticipates that the valuation gap will narrow. At about 9:20 am, shares of the company were trading at Rs 7,492, higher by 3 percent from the last close on the NSE. Apollo Hospitals Enterprises' stock price has gained 10 percent in the last three months.

The firm reported a 54 percent year-on-year rise in consolidated net profit for the fourth quarter of FY25, driven by robust growth across its healthcare services, diagnostics, and digital health platforms. The company also announced a major expansion plan and a final dividend of ₹10 per share. Net profit for Q4FY25 stood at Rs 389.7 crore, up from Rs 253.8 crore in the same quarter last year. Revenue rose 13 percent YoY to Rs 5,592.3 crore, while EBITDA grew 20 percent to Rs 769.9 crore, with margins improving despite continued investments in Apollo 24/7. Apollo announced a rs 8,000 crore investment plan to add over 4,300 beds across India over the next 4 years, including a 700-bed expansion in Bengaluru. The company aims to commission new hospitals in Pune, Kolkata, Hyderabad, and Delhi NCR beginning FY26. At 9.20 am, shares of the firm were quoting Rs 7,025 on the NSE, higher by 2 percent. Follow our market blog to catch all the live updates Should you buy, sell, or hold Apollo Hospitals shares? Nuvama Institutional Equities said, ""Apollo Hospitals is poised to deliver ~16 percent hospital sales growth (FY25–27E) driven by bed additions (~20 percent in FY26) and low teens growth in existing hospitals. While margins may compress in near term, management has identified cost control measures to minimise the impact."" As a result, the brokerage retained its 'buy' rating with an unchanged target price of Rs 8,200. Motilal Oswal said, ""Apollo Hospitals Enterprises posted marginally better-than-expected revenue (4 percent beat), while EBITDA was in-line for the quarter. The lower tax rate led to better-than-expected earnings for the quarter."" The broking house reiterated its 'buy' call, with a price target of Rs 8,050 per share, indicating a 17 percent upside. Furthermore, the brokerage expects a 23 percent CAGR in PAT over FY25-27. This would mainly be driven by the addition of beds in the healthcare services segment coupled with improvement in productivity at existing facilities and a revival in revenue growth and profitability in the diagnostic segment. The Q4FY25 revenue was in line with Nomura's expectation, while EBITDA came in 5 percent ahead of its estimate, supported by higher-than-estimated EBITDA margin in the Healthcare services segment. The brokerage maintained its 'neutral' rating, with a price target of Rs 6,856 per share.

Revenue also grew 14 percent on year to Rs 5,527 crore, largely aligned with expectations of Rs 5,575 crore.

Apollo Hospitals,"Apollo Hospitals jumps 3.5% after KIE's upgrade to 'buy,' forecasting 20% upside",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/apollo-hospitals-jumps-3-5-after-kie-s-upgrade-to-buy-forecasting-20-upside-12915727.html,"Shares of Apollo Hospitals Enterprise jumped 3.5 percent on January 21 after Kotak Institutional Equities upgraded its rating from 'add' to 'buy.' The upgrade was driven by expectations of fewer execution risks, as Apollo’s greenfield bed expansion, though accounting for 70 percent of its total bed growth, is still significantly lower than that of most peers. At 12.47 pm, shares of Apollo Hospitals were trading at Rs 6,981.05 on the NSE. Kotak highlighted Apollo’s 17 percent bed expansion plan for FY25-27, noting that it is lower in percentage terms compared to most peers, which helps reduce earnings risk amid the sector's aggressive expansion spree. The brokerage also emphasised Apollo’s stronger competitive position, supported by its diversified presence and limited exposure to the three potentially hypercompetitive micro-markets of Delhi NCR. Follow our market blog to catch all the live action Kotak marginally raised its price target for Apollo Hospitals to Rs 8,270, naming it as the preferred pick within the hospital sector. While the firm expressed less confidence in Apollo’s 24/7 business, it acknowledged the vertical's strong free cash flow as a mitigating factor. Additionally, Kotak anticipates robust growth in Apollo’s offline pharmacy segment, driven by improving margins and a more measured expansion strategy. However, the ongoing reset in Apollo 24/7’s operating model—marked by reduced digital marketing spends and changes in GMV calculation—may lead to subdued GMV growth in Q3 FY25. Despite this short-term challenge, the brokerage remains optimistic, projecting a rebound in Apollo 24/7’s GMV starting Q1 FY26, driven by pharmacy sales, corporate tie-ups, digital app monetization, and an insurance module ramp-up.

Dabur share price rose 2.57 per cent to close at ₹530.40 in the previous session on Thursday after the company reported its September quarter earnings. On Friday, Dabur share price opened at ₹534.10 and soon rose 1.3 per cent to the level of ₹537.10 on the NSE. Around 9:20 am, the stock was up 0.81 per cent at ₹534.70 on NSE.

Some brokerage firms have maintained their earlier views on the stock while some of them have trimmed their estimates. However, they appear to remain optimistic about the stock. Nuvama Wealth Management has maintained a buy call on the stock but cut the target price to ₹680 from ₹725 earlier. Nuvama said Dabur’s overall Q2FY24 results came in line with its estimate. The beverages portfolio finally bottomed out and started witnessing growth in October. Full-year operating margin guidance stands at nearly 19.5 per cent. The brokerage firm underscored that Dabur has product liability insurance in place if any legal liability arises due to the legal issue. However, the company believes the case has no merits. ""Factoring in the ongoing legal issue, step-up of A&P spends (advertising and promotional spend), raw material cost and a slight uptick in competition intensity for a few of its sub-categories, we cut our FY25E/26E EPS (earnings per share) by 6 per cent each. This, along with an unchanged P/E (price-to-earnings ratio) of 50 times yields a target price of ₹680 from ₹725 earlier,"" said Nuvama. Brokerage firm Motilal Oswal Financial Services also reiterated its buy call on the stock with a target price of ₹660 at 50 times FY25E EPS. The brokerage firm has not made any material changes to its FY24 and FY25 estimates for Dabur. ""Dabur continues to grow and gain share despite persistent challenges in key categories. The recent softening in inflation and improved rural demand have contributed to a revival in volume growth across its portfolio,"" said Motilal Oswal. ""The company's commitment to volume growth, widespread expansion, and capturing market share, combined with a strong pipeline of new product developments, go-to-market strategies, and effective cost management, strengthen our belief in its promising potential. Moreover, the increased investment in advertising and promotions is expected to provide an additional boost to its growth trajectory,"" Motilal Oswal said.

Dabur India,Dabur to report high single digit growth in India business in Q1,https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/dabur-to-report-high-single-digit-growth-in-india-business-in-q1-11688655987244.html,"New Delhi: Packaged consumer goods company Dabur India said demand trends in both urban and rural India reported signs of improvement in the June quarter as inflation ebbed. “During the quarter, trends in both urban and rural India have shown signs of improvement. One of the key contributing factors to this positive development has been the reduction in inflation. Sequential moderation in inflation has positively impacted consumer spending power and is resulting in gradual improvement in offtakes in the industry. Dabur’s consolidated business including recently acquired Badshah Masala, is expected to register growth exceeding 10%,” the company said in its June quarter updated filed to the exchanges on Thursday. The update provides an overall summary of the performance and demand trends witnessed during the quarter ended June 30, 2023; the company is yet to file its quarterly earnings. Meanwhile Dabur’s international business is expected to report a strong performance with double-digit growth in constant currency, the hair oil maker said. “Softening of inflation in international markets is having a positive impact on the business. The healthcare and home and personal care (HPC) businesses in India have performed well and are projected to achieve double-digit growth backed by mid-single digit volume growth. Within HPC, the home care category is expected to report value growth in high teens and oral and hair care categories growing in low double digits. However, the F&B business, and in particular, the summer centric beverages portfolio, had a muted quarter due to unseasonal rains and a moderate summer,” it added. Consequently, India business is expected to post growth in high single digit. Moderating inflation is expected to lead to year-on-year gross margin expansion, the company said. “We are channelizing a major part of the gross margin expansion towards ramping up advertising and promotion (A&P) spends to ensure long-term success. Consequently, operating profit should grow in line with revenue growth. However, PAT growth will be lower than operating profit growth mainly due to brand amortization expenditure on account of acquisition. For the full year, we expect improvement in gross margins to continue,” the company added. Dabur’s update follows those reported by competitors such as Marico and Godrej Consumer Products Ltd., earlier this week. Godrej Consumer Products Limited is expected to report double-digit volume growth in its India business in the June quarter, the company said in its quarterly update on Wednesday.

Dabur India,"Virus scare leads to rush for Dabur’s health products, lifting Q2 results",https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/dabur-s-record-valuations-get-support-from-a-strong-set-of-q2-result-11604398599442.html,"FMCG major Dabur India Ltd surprised the Street with a record double-digit volume growth in the September quarter. Dabur’s domestic business grew 16.8% year-on-year (y-o-y), much higher than the anticipated mid-single-digit growth. The health scare caused by the pandemic led to robust growth in its healthcare business. Contribution of its healthcare portfolio to overall sales increased from 31.8% in Q2FY20 to 39.6% in Q2FY21. The healthcare segment’s revenues rose around 50% y-o-y. Within the healthcare segment, sales of Dabur Chyawanprash grew more than two times, the management said. Dabur’s market share in this category, too, grew by 190 basis points. One basis point is one hundredth of a percentage point. Dabur Honey also saw double-digit sales growth in the quarter. The management told analysts that its market penetration for both products improved compared to last year. However, analysts are wary of high growth sustaining in this segment after the pandemic-related tailwinds subside. Among other segments, home and personal care reported 9.1% growth in revenues. While this pales in comparison to the healthcare business, the growth is decent. International business revenues grew 5.5% y-o-y in Q2. The management attributed muted performance of international business to Middle Eastern and Sub-Sahara regions. Overall macro environment in the Middle East was impacted by weak oil price, it added, but expects business to recover from the current quarter. The company aims to maintain consolidated operating margins at the current 22%. Given the slew of new launches, the management expects advertisement spends to increase. Even though advertisement spends increased by around 40% in the quarter, Dabur’s ad spend-to-revenue ratio at 8% is still lower than 12% of larger peers. So, there is catching up to do to promote new products, it said. As far as cost inflation is concerned, the management said over 50% of raw material is agriculture-related. So, it is contemplating price hikes in select portfolios. Net-net, Dabur posted impressive performance on key earnings parameters. Consolidated revenue grew 13.7% y-o-y to ₹2,516 crore. Consolidated net profit was up 19.5% y-o-y to ₹481.7 crore. Following the earnings announcement, the stock rose more than 3% intraday on the NSE on Tuesday. It ended the day’s session in the green at ₹517.80. The stock is trading at a one-year forward price-to-earnings multiple of around 48 times. Peers Marico Ltd and Godrej Consumer Products Ltd are trading at multiples of around 37 times and 36 times, respectively. Dabur’s valuation looks comparatively pricey, but its robust earnings performance should provide comfort to investors.

Maruti Suzuki shares climbed to the day's high of ₹12,241 apiece on NSE. India's largest automaker commissioned a 20MWp solar power project at its new facility in Kharkhoda, Haryana, and added another 10MWp solar capacity to its Manesar facility. With these additions, MSIL's total solar capacity across its locations has increased from 49MWp to 79MWp in the last one year. “Aligned with our parent company, Suzuki Motor Corporation's Environment Vision 2050i and the Government of India's focus on renewable energy, we are systematically enhancing the use of renewable energy in our operations. By FY2030-31, Maruti Suzuki plans to reach 319MWp of solar capacity, backed by an investment of over INR 925 crore,"" said Hisashi Takeuchi, Managing Director & CEO, Maruti Suzuki India Limited. Besides, the auto giant is increasing the share of green power sourced from the State Electricity Boards for its consumption. These initiatives in solar power and green power will help the company meaningfully shift its dependence towards renewable energy. “As we scale up production to four million units, we are committed to matching that growth with equally ambitious sustainable energy practices. This solar power expansion is a crucial step towards creating a cleaner, more sustainable energy ecosystem and contributes positively to the environment. Through sustained efforts, the share of renewable source of energy in total electricity consumption is expected to reach nearly 85% by FY2030-31,” Takeuchi said. The company is progressively adopting eco-friendly manufacturing methods across all its plants. By significantly expanding its solar energy capacity, it has reinforced its dedication to sustainability and responsible environmental practices.

Maruti Suzuki,Maruti Suzuki India shares dip on delay in new variant e-Vitara launch,https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/maruti-suzuki-india-shares-dip-on-delay-in-new-variant-e-vitara-launch-11749619511668.html,"Maruti Suzuki India share price dropped more than 1% during Wednesday's trading session, as the company has reduced its short-term production goals for its first electric vehicle, the e-Vitara, by two-thirds due to shortages of rare earth materials, according to a report. This situation reflects the ongoing disruptions faced by the automotive industry as a result of China's export restrictions. India's leading automobile manufacturer, which reported on Monday that it hadn't experienced any effects from the supply crisis thus far, is now aiming to produce approximately 8,200 e-Vitaras from April to September, compared to its initial target of 26,500, as per a company document reviewed by Reuters. The company pointed to ""supply constraints"" in rare earth materials essential for the production of magnets and other components across various high-tech sectors. Maruti remains committed to achieving its output goal of 67,000 electric vehicles for the fiscal year ending March 2026 by increasing production in the coming months, the document indicated. Maruti informed reporters last week that the issue concerning rare earths had no significant effect on the launch schedule of the e-Vitara. Chair RC Bhargava mentioned that there was ""no impact at the moment"" on production, according to local media reports on Monday. As reported by Reuters, Maruti and Suzuki did not reply to inquiries for comments on Tuesday. Maruti has yet to start accepting bookings for the e-Vitara, with some analysts cautioning that the company is already behind in launching EVs in the world's third-largest car market, where Tesla is also anticipated to commence sales this year. In its earlier plan ""A,"" Maruti aimed to manufacture 26,512 e-Vitaras between April and September - the first half of the fiscal year. Under the revised plan ""B,"" it now intends to produce 8,221, as indicated in the document, reflecting a reduction of two-thirds in its production schedule. As reported by Reuters, Maruti intends to increase e-Vitara production in the second half of the financial year - from October to March 2026 - to 58,728 units, translating to roughly 440 per day at its peak, compared to an earlier target of 40,437 for those six months under plan A. Two sources from the supply chain verified Maruti's plans to reduce e-Vitara production due to shortages of rare earth magnets but did not have access to the specific figures. Maruti Suzuki India share price today opened at an intraday low of ₹12,397.85 apiece, the stock touched an intraday high of ₹12,555. According to Rajesh Bhosale, Equity Technical and Derivative Analyst at Angel One, this rate sensitive stock had a strong run last week in line with positive development on the monetary policy, however, last two sessions have been subdued. “For now we see a range for the stock where ₹12,200 is a strong support on the flip side once ₹12,700 is taken out, one can expect positive momentum to continue,” said Bhosale.

Maruti Suzuki,"Maruti Suzuki share price rallies 4% to 9-week high after April sales rise 7%
",https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/maruti-suzuki-share-price-rallies-4-to-9-week-high-after-april-sales-rise-7-11746163154150.html,"Maruti Suzuki share price in focus today: Shares of Maruti Suzuki India, the country’s largest automaker, surged 4% in intraday trade on Friday, May 2, touching a 9-week high of ₹12,727 apiece, as investors reacted positively to the company’s April sales numbers released on Thursday. The company reported a 7% increase in total sales to 179,791 units in April, compared to 168,089 units during the same month last year. Domestic passenger vehicle sales rose marginally to 138,704 units from 137,952 units a year ago. However, sales in the mini car segment, which includes the Alto and S-Presso, declined sharply to 6,332 units from 11,519 units in April last year. In contrast, sales of compact cars such as the Baleno, Celerio, Dzire, Ignis, Swift, and WagonR rose to 61,591 units from 56,953 units. Sales of utility vehicles, including the Brezza, Ertiga, Grand Vitara, and XL6, also increased to 59,022 units from 56,553 units. The Eeco van recorded sales of 11,438 units in April, compared to 12,060 units a year earlier, while light commercial vehicle Super Carry sales rose to 3,349 units from 2,496 units. The company also reported that its exports stood at 27,911 units in April, up from 22,160 units in the same month last year. Additionally, Maruti Suzuki released its production figures for the month. Total production in April rose to 179,956 units from 169,751 units a year earlier. Within the passenger vehicle segment, production of mini cars like the Alto and S-Presso fell nearly 29% to 9,714 units from 13,702 units. On the other hand, utility vehicle production — including models like the Brezza, Ertiga, and Fronx — rose by 19% to 72,640 units, reflecting strong demand. However, the company is witnessing a significant decline in demand for entry-level cars. Maruti Suzuki Chairman R.C. Bhargava noted that affordability is a major concern for small car buyers. “Unless something changes, the domestic market will remain muted. In this current year, sales of small cars have declined by about 9%. If there is such a decline in the sales of cars that can be afforded by 88% of people earning, how can we expect growth?” he said. “To boost demand, small cars have to become more affordable,” Bhargava added. “It is not the case that India has become affluent and everyone wants to buy more expensive cars.” The company reported a consolidated net profit of ₹3,911 crore for the January–March 2025 quarter, 1% lower than ₹3,952 crore in the same period last year. Revenue from operations rose 6.6% year-on-year to ₹40,920.1 crore, compared to ₹38,471.2 crore a year ago. Following the Q4FY25 results, the company’s stock target price was revised downward to ₹12,886 from ₹13,290 by Japanese brokerage firm Nomura, while retaining its ‘Neutral.’ rating on the stock. Axis Securities also reduced its target price to ₹11,170 from ₹12,065 but maintained its ‘Buy’ rating.

Maruti Suzuki,"Maruti Suzuki share price edges higher ahead of Q4 results 2025. Buy, sell or hold?

The Indian auto major has set a board meeting date to consider and approve the standalone unaudited Q4 results 2025 on 25 April 2025. Maruti Suzuki share price today opened upside at ₹11,902 apiece on the NSE and touched an intraday high of ₹12,046 per share, recording nearly one per cent rise against Thursday's close of ₹1,894 per share. The Indian auto major has informed the Indian stock market exchanges that the company's board of directors would also discuss the company's proposal for a dividend on equity shares, while debating the unaudited standalone financial results for the January to March 2025 quarter. According to stock market experts, good volume growth driven by higher average selling prices will enable the four-wheeler company to announce a good set of Q4FY25 numbers. However, they are expecting a contraction in YoY EBITDA margins due to higher sales and advertising expenses. Speaking on the market estimates regarding Maruti Suzuki Q4 results today, Seema Srivastava, Senior Research Analyst at SMC Global Securities, said, “Maruti Suzuki India Limited, India’s leading four-wheeler manufacturer, is likely to announce good set of numbers supported by good volume growth driven by higher average selling prices (ASP), and a favorable product mix. However, net profit is expected to dip slightly, reflecting pressures on margins. EBITDA margins will likely contract too YoY primarily due to increased marketing and advertising expenses, deeper discounts, and elevated depreciation and overhead costs from the Kharkhoda plant.” Seema Srivasta, also a certified Chartered Accountant (CA), said that these pressures are partially offset by operating leverage and higher sales of CNG vehicles, which typically offer better margins. The ASP increase is tempered by an unfavourable product mix, with a higher proportion of lower-priced entry-level cars and reduced export contributions. On key things to watch out for in the Maruti Suzuki Q4 results 2025 today, Seema Srivastava of SMC Global Securities said, “Key areas for investors to monitor include updates on Maruti Suzuki’s orderbook, inventory levels, and the anticipated e-Vitara launch, insights into FY26 demand trends, particularly in rural versus urban markets. Additionally, commentary on cost-control strategies, discounting trends, commodity price outlooks, and average price hikes would likely to shape investor sentiment. The company’s stance on hybrid vehicles and related policy developments also warrants attention.” Speaking on the outlook of Maruti Suzuki share price, Mahesh M Ojha, AVP — Research at Hensex Securities, said, “Maruti Suzuki share price has crucial support place at ₹11,600 apiece. On breaking below this support, the auto stock may go down to ₹11,200 per share levels. On the upper side, Maruti Suzuki share price faces hurdle at ₹11,940. On breaking above this resistance on a closing basis, we can expect Maruti Suzuki share price to touch ₹12,400 soon.” Disclaimer: The views and recommendations provided in this analysis are those of individual analysts or broking companies, not Mint.

With a target price of Rs 14,000, analysts at the firm forecast an upside potential of 10.4 percent from the last closing price of Rs 12,671 on the National Stock Exchange. Before this two-day rally, Maruti Suzuki stock had fallen for seven consecutive sessions. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates HSBC says that India’s potential as an export hub for EVs is massive and Maruti Suzuki could be one of the biggest beneficiaries. The brokerage sees monthly EV exports of 5,000–6,000 units as a plausible estimate for Maruti Suzuki's maiden E-Vitara. While percentage margins on exports could be lower, absolute margins are expected to hold steady. HSBC believes that traction in EV exports will be a key driver for the Maruti Suzuki stock. Suzuki Motor Corporation, which holds a 58 percent stake in Maruti Suzuki India, is betting big on India as a global production hub for its latest electric model. The company plans to export the model to over 100 countries, including Japan and Europe, reinforcing India’s role as a key player in EV manufacturing.

Nomura has a Buy call on Ashok Leyland with a target price of Rs 275 per share, reflecting an upside potential of 14.5 percent from the last close of Rs 240 on the NSE. The brokerage noted that Q4 EBITDA was in line with expectations and believes a pick-up in replacement demand could support growth in FY26. It expects 5 percent growth in the medium and heavy commercial vehicle (M&HCV) segment in FY26 and FY27, aided by improved government capital expenditure. Nomura also sees tailwinds from lower interest rates and fuel prices. It forecasts a 15 percent earnings CAGR for FY25–27, and finds current valuations attractive. Morgan Stanley has maintained an Overweight rating with a target price of Rs 284. While revenue came in below estimates, EBITDA exceeded expectations, with margins at 15 percent versus the estimated 14.3 percent. Adjusted profit after tax (PAT), accounting for a write-off of intangible assets and impairment losses, stood at Rs 1,260 crore. On the other hand, HSBC has downgraded Ashok Leyland to Hold, though it raised the target price to Rs 260, an upside of 8 percent from the previous close. The brokerage attributed the strong Q4 operating margins to operating leverage and cost-cutting efforts. However, it flagged concerns that demand and cost-related headwinds could put pressure on margins going forward. The company said it achieved the highest-ever quarterly and annual revenues, EBITDA, and PAT. The overall commercial vehicle volumes were 1,95,093 units in FY25.

Bharat Forge,Bharat Forge shares slump 4 percent fearing demand hit as US EPA rolls back green norms,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/bharat-forge-shares-slump-4-percent-fearing-demand-hit-as-us-epa-announces-rolls-back-regulations-12963798.html,"Shares of Bharat Forge tumbled 4 percent on March 13 in anticipation of a potential business impact, after the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said it will roll back a series of Biden era regulations aimed at reducing pollution and address climate concerns. The move is seen as a step away from policies for electric mobility, and the shares of the company were trading sharply lower during the trading session. US EPA administrator Lee Zeldin on March 12 said he will roll back 31 environmental rules, including norms on pollution from coal-fired power plants, climate change and electric vehicles. He called this the ‘most consequential day of deregulation in American history’, and said the roll back will remove several ‘hidden taxes’ and regulatory costs, lowering the cost of living for American families. ""Our actions will also reignite American manufacturing, spreading economic benefits to communities,"" news reports quoted him saying. ""Zeldin announced the agency will reconsider the Model Year 2027 and Later Light-Duty and Medium-Duty Vehicles regulation and Greenhouse Gas Emissions Standards for Heavy-Duty Vehicles. In addition to imposing over $700 billion in regulatory and compliance costs, these rules provided the foundation for the Biden-Harris electric vehicle mandate that takes away Americans’ ability to choose a safe and affordable car for their family and increases the cost of living on all products that trucks deliver,"" US EPA said. Recently at a conference, Bharat Forge had mentioned that before the EPA regulation take effect in 2027, there could be a surge in the pre-buy demand for its Class 8 trucks in 2026. However, if EPA does not implement the rule in 2027, the expected surge in the early demand for Class 8 trucks may not happen, Bharat Forge added. Sales of US-based Class 8 trucks reportedly contribute to 15 percent of Bharat Forge's standalone revenue. ""The American auto industry has been hamstrung by the crushing regulatory regime of the last administration. As we reconsider nearly one trillion dollars of regulatory costs, we will abide by the rule of law to protect consumer choice and the environment,"" EPA Administrator Zeldin said. The proposals are will now go through a lengthy process of approvals in order to be implemented. Discover the latest Business News, Budget 2025 News, Sensex, and Nifty updates.

Bharat Forge,"Bharat Forge shares surge 4% on mixed Q4 results, escalation of India-Pakistan tensions",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/bharat-forge-shares-surge-4-on-mixed-q4-results-escalation-of-india-pakistan-tensions-13018877.html,"Bharat Forge shares rose by over 4.5 percent to Rs 1,175 per share on May 9, as tensions between India and Pakistan escalated. The company’s Chairman and Managing Director also told CNBC-TV18 that the government has called defence equipment manufacturers to Delhi for discussions. Besides Bharat Forge, other defence-related stocks such as Hindustan Aeronautics, Bharat Dynamics, and Bharat Electronics also gained between 4 to 5 percent after India shot down several Pakistani drones and missile systems on May 8. In its Q4 update, Bharat Forge reported standalone revenue of Rs 2,160 crore, reflecting a 7 percent decline year-on-year. However, EBITDA margin came in higher than expected at 29.1 percent, supported by lower raw material and employee costs. Margin performance across subsidiaries was mixed. The overseas subsidiary showed improvement, with margins increasing to 1.2 percent from 0.3 percent in Q3. In contrast, the India subsidiary saw a decline in margins to 6.1 percent, down from 9.8 percent in Q3. The company has not provided any export guidance due to lack of visibility but said it would focus on improving profitability. Japanese brokerage firm Nomura noted that increased interest in defence following the Pahalgam attack could potentially boost revenues. The firm pointed out that the delivery timeline for the ATAGs guns order has been shortened from three years to two. It also stated that the integration of the AAM from June could lead to an estimated 2 to 3 percent upside. As a result, Nomura maintained a ‘Neutral’ rating with a target price of Rs 1,237. Meanwhile, Nuvama assigned a ‘Hold’ rating to the stock with a target price of Rs 1,230. While the defence order book is strong, Nuvama cautioned that core segments like commercial vehicles and global construction equipment and tractors are expected to show weak performance, which could limit standalone revenue and EBITDA growth.

The stock has been on a steep decline over the past six months, shedding more than 30 percent, significantly underperforming the benchmark Nifty 50 index, which has dropped by 4 percent in the same period. Catch all the market action on our LIVE blog Bharat Forge reported 16.4 percent year-on-year (YoY) drop in net profit to Rs 212 crore in Q3FY25 while revenue from operations fell 7.4 percent YoY to Rs 2,095 crore. At the operating level, EBITDA declined 8 percent YoY to Rs 609 crore and EBITDA margin contracted by 20 basis points (bps) YoY to 29.1 percent. The board declared an interim dividend of Rs 2.50 per equity share of face value of Rs 2 each. The interim dividend will be paid on or before, March 12, with February 18 fixed as the record date. Management attributed the weak performance to sluggish economic conditions in the EU, which weighed on European operations and exports to the region. Additionally, the inherent volatility in the defence business impacted quarterly numbers. On the bright side, Bharat Forge Group secured new orders worth Rs 830 crore across various business verticals in Q3FY25. The company’s defence segment generated revenue of Rs 337 crore in the quarter, while fresh order wins of ₹97 crore pushed the executable order book to Rs 5,706 crore as of December 31. BN Kalyani, Chairman & Managing Director, acknowledged the challenges, telling CNBC-TV18 that this was the first time in the company's history they had seen such a weak quarter. However, he remains optimistic about the growth potential in the defence sector, forecasting a revenue surge to Rs 2,200 crore in FY26. ""Defence is a lumpy business, but annual growth is expected to remain in double digits. The opportunity in this sector will continue to be strong,"" he added.

Bharat Forge,"Tata Motors, Bharat Forge, other auto shares extend tariff-led selloff to crash up to 8%
",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/tata-motors-bharat-forge-other-auto-shares-extend-tariff-led-selloff-to-crash-up-to-8-12984561.html,"Shares of automakers and auto component makers strongly continued to decline on April 4, pulling the Nifty Auto index down nearly 3 percent as the 25% reciprocal tariff on imported automobiles by US President Trump continued to rattle global trade prospects. A report by Tata Mutual Fund said India exports nearly $6.8 billion worth of automobiles and auto components to US, and the tariff announcement is likely to impact the price competitiveness of ancillary companies too. Bharat Forge shares fell nearly 8 percent, owing to its significant exposure to US market, where Class 8 trucks having a strong export base. Bharat Forge Chairman & Managing Director Baba Kalyani had recently said that the US constitutes nearly 20 percent of its total exports, hence, the tariffs are expected to impact their revenue. The company has recently seen a strong decline in the Class 8 truck orders. As per data from ACT Research, cited by CNBC-TV18, Class 8 truck orders in North America have declined for a fourth consecutive month, further fuelling the sharp selloff. Tata Motors shares fell nearly 6 percent as the company is expected to see a significant hit from the tariffs, as subsidiary Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has deep exposure to the American market. JLR sold over 4 lakh units globally in FY24, of which about 23 percent were sold in US alone. ""The US alone contributed over a fifth of JLR's total revenue last year, making it a crucial market. With limited options to maintain margins and meet prior guidance, JLR will likely resort to price hikes and cost efficiencies. However, these strategies won’t yield immediate results, and a near-term hit to both revenue and profitability is expected,"" said Nirav Karkera, Head of Research at Fisdom. ""If JLR can raise prices proportionally, the revenue impact will be minimal. However, if demand falls due to higher prices, both sales volume and margins will suffer,” said Siddhartha Khemka, Head of Research and Wealth Management at Motilal Oswal in a conversation with Moneycontrol. Also Read: Will Indian carmakers, ancillary companies face a speed bump? The selloff in automotive stocks with exposure to US spilled on to domestic-oriented companies as well, with Maruti Suzuki shares dropped nearly 2 percent, while Mahindra & Mahindra shares closed with marginal losses. Nifty Auto index tumbled nearly 3 percent on April 4. Shares of auto component makers like Sona BLW Precision and Samvardhana Motherson also saw a significant decline in their share prices, falling over 6 percent and 7 percent respectively. Vaibhav Porwal, Co-Founder of investment solutions company Dezerv said, ""Export-driven sectors like Information Technology and auto components face significant challenges as they are directly exposed to tariff impacts and broader global trade friction. In this market environment, gains will likely be concentrated in select stocks rather than broadly distributed, making careful stock selection and active management strategies more effective than passive approaches."" Nikunj Saraf from Choice Wealth, said, ""The 26% US tariff on Indian exports introduces near-term economic headwinds, affecting key industries like automobiles, textiles, and gems & jewellery."" During the tariff announcement from the White House on April 2, President Trump had cited high tariff by trading partners to argue for the tariffs. ""Toyota sells one million foreign-made automobiles in the US and General Motors almost sells none. Ford sells very little. None of our companies are allowed to go into other countries,"" Donald Trump had said. ""In many cases, the friend is worse than foe in terms of trade. Such horrendous imbalances have devastated our industrial base, and put our national security at risk.,"" Trump added.

Havells India,"Havells India Q4: Cautious demand commentary sends stock 5% lower, brokerages mixed",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/havells-india-q4-cautious-demand-commentary-sends-stock-5-lower-brokerages-mixed-13001995.html,"Despite a blustering summer, cooling demand for Havells India's room air conditioners has sent the consumer durables player's shares lower in trade on April 23. Havells India posted a 16 percent year-on-year (YoY) rise profit at Rs 518 crore for the forth quarter of the previous financial year, compared to Rs 446 crore in the year-ago period. The revenue for March quarter rose 20 percent to Rs 6,543 crore, as against Rs 5,442 crore reported in the same quarter of 2024. Even though the firm reported a strong earnings beat for the quarter ended March FY2025, the cautious management commentary on lower urban demand for cooling products due to the late onset of summer, especially in South India, sparked a sell-off. The primary sales of RACs remained robust in Q4, while secondary sales slowed down in March and April, which may impact primary sales in Q1. The impact of inflationary pressures on the real estate market needs to be monitored. At 1.50 pm, shares of Havells India were lower by 3 percent on the NSE, quoting Rs 1,615.6 apiece. Follow our market blog to catch all the live updates Revenue growth was supported by strong growth in Lloyd and cable segments, even as certain categories such as switchgear and lighting witnessed muted performance. The firm's EBITDA margin stood at 11.6 percent compared to 11.7 percent on-year, driven by a balanced product mix, improved scale, and control on A&P spends. JM Financial maintained its bullish outlook on Havells shared ""based on its strong brand, distribution, in-house manufacturing, fresh investments in team + brand + distribution, opening up of export opportunity, market share gain, strong balance sheet and improved ratios."" The brokerage has a target price of Rs 1,900 per share. Kotak Institutional Equities said the secondary demand for the room air conditioner industry waned in March/April due to a mild start to summer (particularly in the South), which could weigh on primary sales in 1Q (subject to how the season pans out in the North). As a result, the brokerage kept its 'sell' rating, with a price target of Rs 1,400 apiece. Motilal Oswal noted that the management highlighted that the large appliances and cables fueled revenue growth. The ramp-up of new capacity in the C&W segment is underway. ""We believe the demand pickup in the summer season and the sustainability of Lloyd's margin will be key monitorables in the near term. Wires demand too, has been hit by the slow real estate demand. This has also hurt the margin of wires, and recovery needs to be monitored,"" said the brokerage, keeping its 'neutral' call intact, with a price target of Rs 1,710.

Havells India,Havells India shares rise despite marginal fall in Q3 net profit,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/havells-india-shares-rise-despite-marginal-fall-in-q3-net-profit-12914615.html,"Havells India Ltd shares rose on January 20 even as firm's net profit fell marginally in the December quarter. The home appliances maker's profit fell to Rs 283 crore in the three months ended December 31 from Rs 288 crore a year earlier.

At 1:35 pm on January 20, Havells India shares were trading 1.5% higher at Rs 1,598 apiece. The performance reflected strong demand from its switchgear project business but faced inventory de-stocking in wires during Q3. This had an impact on margins due to an inferior product mix, alongside price deflation in the lighting segment. Lloyd performed well, with losses narrowing, but the stock trades at high valuations of 58x FY26e. Havells India’s subsidiary, Lloyd, posted a strong performance with a narrowing of its losses. However, analysts have raised concerns about the stock's valuation. Currently trading at a high 58x FY26e, Havells has seen its target price revised down by Motilal Oswal Financial Services, Nomura, and Nuvama, following its earnings miss. Nomura lowered its target price to Rs 1,943 from Rs 1,990 per share but upgraded its rating on the stock to 'buy' from 'neutral'. The brokerage expects growth momentum to pick up, projecting a recovery in Havells India's growth, excluding the Lloyd segment, to 17-18 percent over FY26 and FY27. The company’s growth is expected to be driven by new capacities in cables, steady demand in wires, and a trend toward premiumisation in electric cables.

Delhivery,Delhivery shares soar over 9% as Q4 profit swings to black; full-year earnings mark strong turnaround,https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/delhivery-shares-soar-over-9-as-q4-profit-swings-to-black-full-year-earnings-mark-strong-turnaround-11747629078684.html,"Shares of Delhivery surged more than 9 percent in intra-day trade on Monday, May 19, after the company reported a turnaround in its March quarter (Q4FY25) earnings, with a positive net profit following a string of losses in previous periods. Strong operational efficiency and improving profitability across its core business segments drove the gains. The logistics major posted a consolidated net profit of ₹72.56 crore in Q4FY25, a sharp improvement from a net loss of ₹68.47 crore in the year-ago period. On a sequential basis, net profit nearly tripled from ₹24.99 crore in Q3FY25, underscoring strong cost discipline and margin expansion. Revenue from operations for the quarter stood at ₹2,191.57 crore, registering a 5.6 percent year-on-year (YoY) growth, although it fell 7.8 percent quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) from ₹2,378.30 crore. Despite the sequential dip, the profitability metrics showed significant improvement. EBITDA stood at ₹119 crore, up 160 percent YoY and 16.3 percent QoQ, with EBITDA margin rising to 5.4 percent, a 322 basis point increase YoY and 113 bps QoQ. This margin improvement is being viewed as a key indicator of the company’s strategic focus on operational leverage. For the full financial year ending March 31, 2025, Delhivery reported a consolidated net profit of ₹162.11 crore, marking a reversal from the loss of ₹249.19 crore in FY24. Annual revenue rose 10 percent to ₹8,932 crore, up from ₹8,142 crore last year. Commenting on the results, Sahil Barua, Managing Director and CEO of Delhivery, said, “We continue to deliver steady performance in our core transportation businesses. Our ongoing measures to improve profitability are visible in Q4 numbers and we expect continued momentum on this front as growth picks up in FY26.” In terms of volumes, Delhivery shipped 177 million parcels in Q4FY25, up marginally from 176 million in Q4FY24. For the full year FY25, total parcel volumes reached 752 million, rising 2 percent from 740 million in FY24. The company also recently announced plans to acquire a controlling stake in Ecom Express for ₹1,400 crore, aiming to strengthen its footprint in India’s e-commerce logistics space. Both companies have approached the Competition Commission of India (CCI) for approval. Delhivery’s stock rallied as much as 9.3 percent to hit ₹350.80, reacting to the positive earnings. The stock, however, remains 24 percent below its 52-week high of ₹461, hit in May 2024. It touched a 52-week low of ₹236.80 in March 2025. Despite the long-term underperformance — down over 26 percent in the past year — the stock has seen a strong rebound in recent months. It gained 15.5 percent so far in May, extending its rally after a 20 percent jump in April and 2 percent rise in March. The recovery followed steep declines of 22 percent in February and 7.2 percent in January.

Delhivery,"Delhivery to acquire Ecom Express for ₹1,407 crore amid layoffs and pause on IPO plans
",https://www.livemint.com/companies/delhivery-to-acquire-ecom-express-for-rs-1-407-crore-11743838287981.html,"Third-party logistics company Delhivery will acquire Ecom Express Limited for ₹1,407 crore. The company informed the exchanges on Saturday, April 5, that the Board has approved to buy nearly 99.4% of shares of Ecom Express. ""We wish to inform you that the board of directors of Delhivery Limited (""the Board"" and ""the Company"", respectively) at its meeting held today, ie, April 5, 2025, inter-alia, has considered and approved the acquisition of shares equivalent to at least 99.4% of the issued and paid up share capital, on a fully diluted basis, of Ecom Express Limited (""Ecom""/""Target Company""), for a purchase consideration not exceeding INR 1,407 Crore,"" the company said in an exchange filing. The completion of the acquisition is subject to approval from the Competition Commission of India. Following the acquisition process, Ecom Express will become a subsidiary of Delhivery. Speaking on the latest acquisition, Sahil Barua, MD and CEO, Delhivery said, “The Indian economy requires continuous improvements in cost efficiency, speed and reach of logistics. We believe this acquisition will enable us to service customers of both companies better."" In February, Mint reported that Ecom Express had laid off nearly 500 employees and paused its plans to launch an initial public offering (IPO) of its shares in an attempt to cut costs. The company’s expenses marginally rose to ₹2,921.5 crore in FY24 from ₹2,902.8 crore in FY23. Ecom Express reported a 2.2% growth in revenue to ₹2,609.2 crore in FY 24, and its losses declined to ₹255.8 crore from ₹428.1 crore in the previous year. The company had nearly 15,600 employees and associates and delivered goods to more than 27,000 pin codes, according to Ecom Express website. The report said it had put a hold on plans to go public due to volatile market conditions. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) approved the IPO in December, and it is valid until later this year. In August, filed papers to raise ₹2,600 crore through IPO, which included a fresh infusion of ₹1,284.5 crore worth of shares and an offer-for-sale. Meanwhile, in January, Delhivery launched Rapid Commerce, a sub-2-hour delivery service.

Delhivery,Delhivery's stock slump deepens; can healthy Q2 numbers reverse the slide?,https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/delhivery-stock-slump-deepens-can-healthy-q2-numbers-reverse-the-slide-11732095345468.html,"A few stocks on Dalal Street continue to face extended sell-off pressure due to a variety of factors, including weak financial performance, rising competition, softening demand, and macroeconomic headwinds. As a result, these stocks remain sidelined, despite the overall market performing exceptionally well. One such stock in this regard is Delhivery—India's largest fully integrated logistics services provider—which has been on a downward trajectory since August 2022, with no significant pullbacks. The sell-off has intensified recently, with the stock declining 16.2% in October and an additional 3.3% this month to ₹344.25. At current levels, Delhivery’s stock is trading 51.4% lower from its all-time high of ₹708, attained in July 2022. This significant underperformance can be attributed to several factors, including a slowdown in the third-party logistics (3PL) market, increasing in-sourcing at Meesho, and the rapid growth of quick commerce within e-commerce, where logistics are typically managed in-house. Additionally, the rising market share of competitors in the 3PL space has further compounded the stock’s struggles. However, analysts expect a turnaround in the company's shares following its Q2FY25 performance, supported by new initiatives, a pickup in e-commerce demand, and expectations of a shift in Meesho’s volumes to Valmo. The company reported revenue from services at ₹2,190 crore in Q2FY25, marking a 13% YoY growth compared to ₹1,942 crore in Q2FY24. This growth was primarily driven by the PTL segment, which saw a 27% YoY increase to ₹474 crore, while express parcel, accounting for 60% of total revenue, grew steadily by 7% YoY to ₹1,298 crore, despite being a seasonally weak quarter ahead of the peak festival season. EBITDA surged to ₹57 crore in Q2FY25, reflecting a YoY improvement of ₹73 crore compared to an EBITDA loss of ₹16 crore in Q2FY24. The company also reported a profit for the second consecutive quarter, with a profit after tax (PAT) of ₹10 crore in Q2FY25, a YoY increase of ₹113 crore, compared to a loss of ₹103 crore in Q2FY24. The PTL B2B segment has grown significantly at 20% in H1FY25 compared to peers struggling for growth. The company expects growth to continue with improvement in profitability on better efficiency of automation in hubs and network centres. It envisages current service EBITDA of 3% to improve to 15-16% in the long term on operating synergies. The express segment is also likely to grow on expectations of eCommerce demand picking up, which is currently experiencing softness. The company has stabilised volume from eCommerce giants like Meesho post commencement of its in-house logistics operations, Valmo. Domestic brokerage firm Elara Securities said that the company aims to enhance its service quality and growth in both PTL and express segments through initiatives such as increasing next-day delivery by reducing return rates, foray into the air express segment by operating on prime flights from currently non-prime, undertaking rapid commerce by delivering products in 4-5 hours (already started a pilot project at Bengaluru), and expansion of current 120 freight station presence across smaller cities, aiming at large volumes from SME and individual customers with further gaining volumes from the existing express partner centre network. Following the company's Q2 numbers, domestic brokerage firm Elara Capital retained its 'buy' rating on the stock with a target price of ₹570 apiece, which indicates an upside potential of 65.6% from the stock's previous day closing price. ""Focus continues on ramping up volume and improving profitability. Overall growth momentum is likely to continue with new areas getting unlocked. We remain hopeful of an uptick in capacity utilisation,"" said the brokerage. Disclaimer: The views and recommendations given in this article are those of individual analysts.

Delhivery,Mutual funds boost holding in Delhivery to all-time high in September quarter,https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/mutual-funds-boost-holding-in-delhivery-to-all-time-high-in-september-quarter-11729076810095.html,"Mutual funds significantly increased their stake in Delhivery, a logistics and supply chain services provider, during the second quarter of the current fiscal year (Q2FY25) to an all-time high. As of the end of September 2024, 22 mutual funds collectively held a 24.91% stake in Delhivery, equivalent to 18.43 crore shares. This marks a notable increase from the 19.05% stake held at the close of the previous quarter in June, according to Trendlyne’s shareholding data. Mutual funds have been gradually accumulating shares in Delhivery over time, with the most substantial rise occurring in the recently-concluded quarter. Some of the key mutual funds that raised stakes include SBI Equity Hybrid Fund, which now holds an 8.89% stake in the company, Mirae Asset Large & Midcap Fund, which owns a 6.13% stake, and HDFC Mid-Cap Opportunities Fund, which has a 3.72% ownership. This increase comes as the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) completed the sale of its remaining shares in Delhivery during the quarter. CPPIB offloaded its 3.18% stake, or 2.34 crore shares, through multiple block deals in July, generating approximately ₹910.2 crore. Before Delhivery’s IPO in May 2022, CPPIB had been a major investor, holding about 4.38 crore shares. In April this year, CPPIB sold 2.04 crore shares for ₹908 crore. As of Q2FY25, foreign institutional investors (FIIs) remained the majority shareholders in Delhivery, holding a 55% stake. The remaining 16.4% ownership is with the general shareholders, Trendlyne data showed. Delhivery's shares have shown a notable recovery in recent months but are still trading below their IPO price of ₹487. The stock, currently at ₹408, has seen a decline of 16.22% from the issue price. Domestic brokerage firm Kotak Institutional Equities in its latest note revised the price target on the stock downwards to ₹500 apiece from the previous target of ₹560, while maintaining its 'buy' rating. The brokerage adjusted its estimates, factoring in a single-digit year-over-year growth in express parcel volumes for Q2 and Q3, considering the shift of Meesho’s volumes to Valmo during this period. The near-term impact on third-party logistics providers like Delhivery remains uncertain, particularly during the initial stages of Valmo’s entry into the logistics market. This phase might involve absorbing cash burn to either develop new business opportunities or mitigate the potential influence of third-party logistics providers on pricing over time, said the brokerage. Kotak now projects an 8% and 13% year-over-year growth in express parcel volumes for FY2025 and FY2026, respectively. This forecast also considers the impact of quick-commerce models on the e-commerce sector, as Delhivery's rapid delivery service, offering 4 to 6-hour delivery, is still in the early stages of development. The strength of its Q1 print for Express Parcel’s service margin is encouraging, said the brokerage, however, it notes the risk from peers using internal and external proceeds to bring down pricing in the near term to gain relevance in non-Meesho customer sets. In this context, the brokerage noted that the company is likely to focus on expanding gross margins by leveraging improvements in its cost structure rather than implementing price hikes. Additionally, the company aims to maintain strict control over corporate costs, providing further potential for margin enhancement.

Delhivery,Delhivery expects rapid commerce business to generate ₹80-100 crore by fiscal end,https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/delhivery-expects-rapid-commerce-business-to-generate-80-100-crore-by-fiscal-end-pat-profitable-quarter-revenue-11738938951694.html,"Listed third-party logistics player Delhivery Ltd expects its one-month-old rapid commerce business to generate revenue in the range of ₹80-100 crore by the end of the current fiscal year, underscoring the growing demand for ultra-fast deliveries in India’s e-commerce landscape, co-founder and chief executive officer Sahil Barua, said on Friday. The Gurugram-based courier company rolled out Rapid Commerce, a sub-2-hour delivery service, in January. It is specifically designed to help direct-to-consumer brands, and e-commerce platforms reduce delivery timelines and improve customer experience. “Rapid Commerce is an add-on product for the top eight cities [designed] for specific customers and SKUs [stock-keeping units]. I expect that this business will add maybe somewhere between 80 and 100 crore [rupees] of revenue to Delhivery through the financial year. And the margin structure will broadly be similar to the express business as a whole,” Barua said during the third-quarter earnings call. “It's an interesting business. It's a good capability for Delhivery to build. It helps us serve our D2C customers and their customers much better,” Barua added. The service is live in Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Chennai and is scheduled to add another 15 clients by the end of the next quarter. Competition in quick commerce is heating up, prompting players to increase investments in expanding dark stores and hiring more personnel to keep delivery timelines short. On Friday, logistics provider DTDC launched 2-4 hour express delivery with its first dark store in Bengaluru. In May, logistics aggregator Shiprocket introduced ‘Quick’ to assist small and medium-sized businesses join the quick commerce rush. Barua said that Delhivery’s first set of dark stores is already logging 500 orders daily and is expected to break even when it touches 700-800. The contribution of direct-to-consumer brands to Delhivery’s express volumes has now grown to 30%, while that of small and medium businesses has surged to 50%. The company plans to add up to 50 dark stores to service the top eight metro cities. Delhivery’s profit after tax zoomed 114% year-on-year to ₹25 crore in the December quarter, marking its third consecutive profitable quarter. Its revenue from operations grew 8% to ₹2,378 crore from the year-ago period. Express parcel revenue grew 3% YoY to ₹1,488 crore, while part truckload revenue grew 22% YoY to ₹462 crore. Former global CEO of Airtel Vani Venkatesh joined Delhivery as the chief business officer, the firm said in a statement on Friday. Venkatesh has over two decades of experience across industry verticals, having served in leadership roles in companies like Airtel, McKinsey, Unilever and Abbott Nutrition. She previously served Airtel in various management roles, including CEO for Global Business, CEO for Delhi NCR Region, chief marketing officer & CEO for their Retail Business. On Friday, the firm also appointed Namita Thapar, executive director at Emcure Pharmaceuticals Ltd, and Sameer Mehta, co-founder and CEO of boAt Lifestyle, as non-executive independent directors to the board.

Delhivery,Delhivery shares slip 5% to hit all-time low after Q3 earnings miss estimates,https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/delhivery-shares-slip-5-to-hit-all-time-low-after-q3-earnings-miss-estimates-11739166461622.html,"Stock market today: Extending their weakness to the third straight day on Monday, February 10, shares of Delhivery, the country's largest fully integrated logistics services provider, tumbled another 5%, slipping below the ₹300 mark for the first time since their listing in May 2022 to record a fresh all-time low of ₹299.80 apiece. Today's decline came after the company's December quarter numbers missed analysts' estimates. Despite Q3 being a seasonally strong quarter for Express Parcel due to festivities, the company failed to deliver robust growth, impacted by a consumption slowdown, the rise of quick commerce, and increased insourcing at Meesho. Moreover, analysts noted higher rental costs following the Bangalore facility going live, along with increased vehicle rental expenses due to heavy volumes in the first week of the festive season, and subdued margin expansion. Considering these challenges, domestic brokerage firm JM Financial lowered its target price for the stock to ₹380 from ₹420, while retaining its 'buy' rating. Delhivery’s shares have been on a downward trajectory, closing in the red for each of the past four months. Over this period, the stock has corrected by 30% and is down 58% from its all-time high of ₹708, attained in July 2022. This significant underperformance can be attributed to several factors, including a slowdown in the third-party logistics (3PL) market, increasing insourcing at Meesho, and the rapid expansion of quick commerce within e-commerce. In the December quarter, the company reported revenue from services of ₹2,378 crore in Q3, a growth of 8% as compared to ₹2,194 crore in the same quarter last fiscal. EBITDA reduced marginally to ₹102 crore from ₹109 crore in Q3 FY24. Profit after tax (PAT) grew 114% YoY to ₹25 crore in Q3 FY25 from ₹12 crore in Q3 FY24, making it the third consecutive profitable quarter for the company. The Express Parcel segment revenue stood at ₹1,488 crore, reflecting a sequential growth of 14.6% (2.8% YoY), driven by an 11.4% QoQ (2.5% YoY) increase in volume and a 0.3% QoQ (3.0% YoY) rise in realization. ""While volume growth was subdued due to overall consumption softness, rising quick commerce, and increased insourcing at Meesho, the almost flat realization despite the growth in 'heavy' shipments was surprising,"" said JM Financial. The brokerage channel checks suggest that Meesho’s insourcing has reached 60–65%, indicating that any further increase would be gradual. On the other hand, PTL volume declined by 3.4% QoQ (+16.6% YoY), while realizations improved by 0.9% QoQ (+4.5% YoY), leading to a sequential revenue decline of 2.5% (+21.8% YoY). The segment sustained a positive service EBITDA margin at 3.9% (compared to 2.9% in 2QFY25 and -1.8% in 3QFY24). However, the brokerage noted that the margin uptick was not as sharp as expected because the company operates an integrated network, requiring the PTL business to bear some of the costs of expanding the network for express and heavy shipments. The company has launched its rapid commerce operations in Bangalore, Hyderabad, and Chennai, with two core customers currently live and 15 more scheduled to start in 4Q. The brokerage noted that the dark store model has gained early traction, with the first store, launched about 45 days ago, now handling nearly 500 orders per day. ""The breakeven point is estimated at 700–800 orders per day, and the business is expected to reach profitability within a year. Positioned as an add-on service for the top eight cities and select SKUs, rapid commerce is seen as a valuable capability to better serve D2C brands,"" said the brokerage. According to the company's management, this business could contribute ₹0.8–1.0 billion in incremental revenue over the coming fiscal year.

Delhivery,Delhivery block deal: 1.2 crore shares worth Rs 461 crore change hands,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/delhivery-block-deal-1-2-crore-shares-worth-rs-461-crore-change-hands-13180421.html,"Delhivery Ltd shares traded flat on Thursday, June 26, after a large deal involving shares worth Rs 461 crore took place on the exchanges. Around 1.19 crore shares worth Rs 461 crore changed hands in the block deal window at Rs 388 per share. This is a minor discount to the previous session's closing price of Rs 388.15 per share. Moneycontrol could not immediately ascertain the buyers and the sellers in the deal. At 9.25 a.m., shares of the firm were quoting Rs 388.85, higher by 0.2 percent on the NSE. Follow our market blog to catch all the live updates Delhivery on June 17 announced that the CCI has approved its proposal to acquire 99.4 percent stake in rival Ecom Express for up to Rs 1,407 crore. Delhivery had earlier said that the acquisition will improve asset utilisation and boost profitability by adding to shipment volumes and eliminating overlapping costs. It also expects fewer integration challenges compared to its 2021 acquisition of SpotOn Logistics, which faced customer and volume absorption hurdles. Earlier this year, Macquarie kept an 'outperform' call on Delhivery stock, while keeping a target price of Rs 380 per share. The international brokerage said that the primary driver for the stock's recent fall is the sharp changes in third party logistics industry structure, fuelled by its key customer Meesho's internalisation push. Notably, the e-commerce platform Meesho is reportedly working to launch an IPO in India, after reverse-flipping from US. Macquarie added that despite the poor near-term visibility for Delhivery's stock, it expects the company to accelerate its market share in this 'Winner-Takes-All' industry. Delhivery had reported a 114 percent year-on-year (YoY) rise in its consolidated net profit at Rs 25 crore for the third quarter of financial year 2024-25 (FY25). The Gurugram-based company's revenue from operations stood at Rs 2,378 crore in Q3 FY25, up 8 percent YoY from Rs 2,194 crore in Q3FY24.

Delhivery,"Delhivery shares drop 3% on Jefferies downgrade, sees another 8% potential fall",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/delhivery-shares-drop-3-on-jefferies-downgrade-sees-another-8-potential-fall-13150536.html,"Shares of Delhivery dropped 3 percent to Rs 343 apiece on June 20 after global brokerage Jefferies downgraded the stock to “underperform” from “buy,” while slashing the target price to Rs 315 from Rs 500. This implies a potential downside of 8 percent from current market levels. While Delhivery’s stock has traded mostly sideways over the past six months, it has climbed nearly 40 percent from April lows. Catch all the market action on our LIVE blog Jefferies flagged a key risk from Meesho’s move to bring logistics operations in-house, which may hurt Delhivery’s third-party (3PL) express parcel business. According to Jefferies, although Delhivery shares rallied 41 percent after its acquisition of Ecom Express—driven by hopes of industry consolidation—the express parcel segment is now expected to see slower growth. The brokerage forecasted industry volumes to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 10 percent between FY25 and FY30, down from 30 percent between FY20 and FY25. It also expects marketplace share in the 3PL space to shrink to 34 percent by FY28. Meanwhile, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) approved Delhivery’s proposed acquisition of a majority stake in rival Ecom Express. The Gurugram-based logistics company, which focuses on e-commerce deliveries, reported a revenue of Rs 2,607.3 crore in FY24, compared to Rs 2,548.1 crore in FY23. Delhivery said the acquisition fits with its goal of becoming India’s most comprehensive logistics platform. The company expects that Ecom Express’ experience in high-volume and secure deliveries—especially in tier-2 and tier-3 cities—will enhance its service footprint and improve efficiency. On the financial front, Delhivery posted its first full-year net profit in FY25, reporting Rs 162 crore compared to a loss of Rs 249 crore in FY24. For the March quarter, it recorded a net profit of Rs 72.6 crore, reversing a loss of Rs 68.5 crore in the same period last year. Quarterly revenue rose 5.6 percent year-on-year to Rs 2,191.6 crore, while EBITDA almost tripled to Rs 119 crore from Rs 45.7 crore. Operating margins improved to 5.45 percent from 2.2 percent a year ago.

The shares of the company were hovering around Rs 264 apiece in morning trade. Macquarie kept an 'Outperform' call on Delhivery stock, while keeping a target price of Rs 380 per share. The latest target price implies an upside potential of nearly 48 percent from its previous closing price of Rs 257 per share. This comes despite the recent downfall in the stock, falling nearly 40 percent from its September levels as against the 17 percent fall in the Nifty smallcap index.

Delhivery,"Delhivery shares defy market sentiment, jump 4% on Ecom Express acquisition",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/delhivery-shares-defy-market-sentiment-jump-4-on-ecom-express-acquisition-12987481.html,"E-commerce player Delhivery shares gained four percent in a sour market, as the Street was bullish on the firm’s latest acquisition of logistics firm Ecom Express. At 3.15 pm, Delhivery’s stock was quoting Rs 267.6, higher by 3.4 percent on the NSE compared to the previous session’s closing price. Delhivery has formally announced its decision to acquire a rival firm, Ecom Express Limited, for a total sum of Rs 1,407 crore. The acquisition, undertaken as a cash deal, once completed, will make Ecom Express a subsidiary to Delhivery following regulatory approvals. Domestic brokerages JM Financials and Emkay Global reiterated their bullish ‘buy’ rating, with a target price of Rs 400 and Rs 380, respectively. “By combining forces, the companies intend to provide a more seamless and enhanced service experience to their collective customer base. Delhivery sees strategic value in Ecom’s experienced team and robust network, with the company potentially gaining the opportunity to cherry pick the right facilities,” said JM Financial. The brokerage added that after an initial period, Delhivery would take a bottom-up approach to retain the necessary Ecom Express facilities while transitioning the majority of the business to its network as substantial overlap is likely to exist. Emkay has also reiterated its ‘buy’ call. “The combined entity would command ~55-60 percent market share of the 3PL B2C express market, dwarfing the immediate peer by ~3x. Apart from scale benefits, given that both operators service ~97 percent of pin-codes in India, we believe there are significant cost synergies to be realized over the next 12-18 months.” Over the past year, shares of Delhivery have crashed 41 percent, as against a two percent fall in the frontline Nifty 50 index.

Paytm (One97),Paytm shares partially recover after tumbling 10% post FinMin's clarification on MDR speculation,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/paytm-shares-tumble-10-after-finmin-says-no-plan-to-levy-mdr-charge-on-upi-transactions-13112058.html,"Paytm shares partially recovered losses after crashing over 10 percent in the morning of June 12, after the Finance Ministry issued a clarification that no merchant discount rate (MDR) will be charged on UPI transactions. The shares of the fintech company were trading at Rs 864 apiece in the morning to emerge as the top loser on the Nifty Midcap index. They later recovered slightly to trade over 6 percent lower at Rs 899 apiece. Finance Ministry's clarification came after reports suggested that the government is planning to introduce MDR on transactions worth Rs 3,000 and above to support banks and payment solution providers. The reports had further claimed that the government may permit lenders to levy MDR on the transaction value rather than merchant turnover. Paytm shares had surged to over a three-month high of Rs 978 apiece after the reports surfaced. Finance Ministry took to X in the post market hours of June 11 to issue the clarification. ""Speculation and claims that the MDR will be charged on UPI transactions are completely false, baseless, and misleading,"" it said. ""Such baseless and sensation-creating speculations cause needless uncertainty, fear and suspicion among our citizens. The Government remains fully committed to promoting digital payments via UPI,"" it added.Speculation and claims that the MDR will be charged on UPI transactions are completely false, baseless, and misleading.Such baseless and sensation-creating speculations cause needless uncertainty, fear and suspicion among our citizens.The Government remains fully committedMinistry of Finance (@FinMinIndia) June 11, 2025 MDR is a fee which banks charge merchants for processing payments in real time. Earlier, merchants were charged an MDR fee amounting to 1 percent of the total transaction value on card payments. Later in 2020, the government waived off MDR charges to promote digital payments in the country. Earlier this year, the Payment Council of India urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government to reconsider Zero MDR policy for UPI transactions. In its letter, the industry body highlighted the pressing financial sustainability concerns facing the digital payments ecosystem due to the continued Zero MDR policy, which has been in effect since January 2020. While the government has provided financial incentives to offset some of the ecosystem's operational costs, the letter points out that the Rs 1,500 crore allocation covers only a fraction of the estimated Rs 10,000 crore annual cost required to maintain and expand UPI services. Also read: Our LIVE blog on stock market updates To address the challenge, the industry proposed the introduction of an MDR for RuPay debit cards for all merchants and a reasonable MDR of 0.3 per cent for UPI only for large merchants.

Several brokerages have issued bullish calls for the stock, adding to the share price rally. Notably, Paytm is now close to break even as its Rs 540-crore loss included a one-time cost of Rs 522 crore during the quarter under review. The Noida-based company's one-time cost was in relation to the 21 million Employee Stock Options (ESOPs) which were granted to the Managing Director and CEO Vijay Shekhar Sharma. Paytm also reported EBITDA positive with a surplus of Rs 81 crore during Q4. Its revenue from operations however tumbled 16 percent year-over-year to Rs 1,912 crore.

Motilal Oswal reiterates 'Neutral' rating with Rs 870 target price After Paytm's Q4 results were released, Motilal Oswal reiterated its 'neutral' rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 870 apiece. ""Paytm reported a year of recovery in business metrics during FY25. Disbursement recovery is well on track, led by healthy disbursements in merchant loans. GMV also demonstrated steady state recovery. Most business metrics continue to improve as recovery progresses. We expect a steady business recovery, leading to a 29% revenue CAGR over FY25-27,"" the domestic brokerage said. ""We maintain our contribution profit estimates and project PAYTM to turn EBITDA positive by FY27,"" it added. JM Financial reiterates 'Buy' rating with Rs 1,070 target price JM Financial reiterated its 'Buy' rating on the stock, with a target price of Rs 1,070 apiece. The latest target price implies an upside potential of nearly 22 percent from the stock’s current market price. ""Even excluding incentive, company reported 1% sequential growth, despite 4Q being a seasonally weak quarter. While Payments GMV remained flat QoQ, strong growth in Financial Services (via merchant loans) drove the uptick… Management expects Paytm to turn PAT positive next quarter along with multiple growth triggers such as MDR on UPI, return of wallet, etc,"" the brokerage said. Emkay Global reiterates 'Buy' rating with Rs 1,050 target price Emkay Global retained its 'Buy' rating on the stock, with a target price of Rs 1,050. The latest target price implies an upside potential of over 19 percent from the stock’s current market price. ""Though Paytm reduced overall loss in FY25 mainly due to business consolidation and cost optimization, we expect it to turn net profit-positive in FY26 on the back of revenue acceleration from payment as well as the financial services business, higher treasury income on cash balance boosted by recent stake sales, and lower depreciation/ESOP cost,"" Emkay said. Jefferies maintains 'Buy' rating with Rs 1,100 target price Jefferies maintained its 'Buy' rating on the stock, and hiked its target price to Rs 1,100 apiece, according to a note seen by CNBC-TV18 This implies an upside potential of nearly 25 percent from the stock’s current market price.

Paytm expects to become profitable from the first quarter of the current fiscal year, it said last week, after posting a narrower sequential loss excluding a one-time charge.

Paytm (One97),"Paytm shares rise 2% after Supreme Court stays Rs 5,700 crore GST notice against subsidiary First Games",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/paytm-shares-rise-2-after-supreme-court-stays-rs-5-700-crore-gst-notice-against-subsidiary-first-games-13045621.html,"Shares of digital platform Paytm gained nearly 2 percent in the early trade on May 26 after a company filing said that the Supreme Court has stayed a GST show cause notice worth Rs 5,712 crore against its private subsidiary First Games Technology. In the exchange filing shared on May 24, Paytm said the Supreme Court has stayed the proceeding on a show cause notice issued by the Directorate General of GST Intelligence (DGGI) over the proposed GST liability of Rs 5,712 crore against the company's subsidiary First Games. ""Further proceedings of all the impugned show cause notices shall remain stayed till the final disposal of the main matter along with all the matters which are tagged,"" the company cited the Supreme Court order as saying. In an earlier exchange filing released in late April, Paytm had said that First Games had received the show cause notice wherein the Directorate General of GST Intelligence (DGGI) had taken the view that GST liability should be calculated at 28 percent on the total entry amount. This is higher than the 18 percent GST paid on the platform fee generated by the gaming companies. ""This is an industry-wide issue where the GST department has sent notices to several gaming companies previously. This matter is currently pending with the Honourable Supreme Court and they have granted interim relief by staying further proceedings,"" the company had said. Paytm also said First Games will be filing a writ petition challenging the notice and its proposed liability of Rs 5,712 crore for the period from January 2018 to March 2023.

Nykaa witnessed a continued growth momentum in Q4, and the firm's consolidated net revenue is expected to grow in low to mid twenties on-year. ""With this, Nykaa’s full financial year FY2025 revenue growth is estimated to be at similar levels in mid‐twenties, indicating consistent growth across all quarters of FY2025,"" said the firm in an exchange filing. Follow our market blog to catch all the live updates The company’s Beauty vertical continued to outperform the broader industry, with Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) growth projected in the low thirties. Nykaa attributed this to sustained investments in customer acquisition, strong order volume growth, and robust retail performance. Another key growth lever has been the ‘House of Nykaa’ strategy, with both homegrown and acquired brands performing strongly. Net revenue growth for the Beauty business remained steady in the mid-twenties, in line with recent quarters. Nykaa’s Fashion vertical, meanwhile, saw GMV growth in the high teens, reflecting a sequential improvement in the core platform business. However, net revenue growth lagged due to a subdued performance from its owned brands and a dip in content-driven activity in Q4, which typically sees higher engagement in the festive-heavy third quarter. Japanese brokerage Nomura reiterated its neutral call on the internet player, with a target price of Rs 190 per share. The brokerage said that the beauty and personal care GMV growth was along expected lines, however, while it predicted 11.1 percent growth for the fashion segment's GMV as against the high teens growth reported. Overall, Nomura had predicted mid-20s revenue growth, at around 25 percent for the firm in Q4. Over the past year, shares of Nykaa have traded flat, falling one percent.

The strong revenue uptick was primarily driven by the company’s core beauty vertical, which recorded accelerated growth compared to previous quarters. Nykaa had also anticipated the gross merchandise value (GMV) of this segment to grow in the low thirties, fuelled by robust momentum across multiple channels—including its e-commerce platform, retail stores, owned brands, and eB2B distribution. Catch all the market action on our LIVE blog At 10.09 am, shares of FSN E-commerce were trading at Rs 172.98 on the NSE.

Nykaa,"InCred Equities initiates coverage on Nykaa with a reduce rating; cuts target price by 39%
",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/incred-equities-initiates-coverage-on-nykaa-with-a-reduce-rating-cuts-target-price-by-39-12906489.html,"InCred Equities has initiated coverage on FSN E-Commerce Ventures Ltd, the parent company of Nykaa, with a ""Reduce"" rating and a lowered target price. The outlook highlights a plateauing revenue growth trajectory coupled with shrinking EBITDA margins, pressured by rising costs of goods sold (COGS) and intensifying competition. The brokerage house has cut target price by 39 percent to Rs 103 a share from current market price. On January 9, Nykaa's shares on NSE were trading 0.39% higher at Rs 170.18 apiece. Nykaa’s revenue growth is normalising after a period of strong expansion—55% in FY22, 36% in FY23, and 24% in FY24. Future growth is projected at 26% for FY25F and 25% for FY26F-FY27F, according to InCred Equities. The deceleration is attributed to slowing growth in the beauty and personal care (BPC) segment, which accounts for 73% of GMV. Increasing cost of goods sold, driven by competition from Tira in the luxury segment and a shift toward lower-margin mass/masstige products, presents key challenges, it said. Additionally, the low-margin eB2B segment is compounding these pressures. While fulfillment costs could see some relief with the addition of new warehouses, rising marketing expenses and intensified competition are expected to further squeeze EBITDA margins, which are projected to decline to 5.1% by FY27F, it said. Nykaa’s high-margin services, including marketing support and marketplace services, have seen a sharp slowdown. Marketing services growth decelerated from 92% in FY22 to 18% in FY24, while marketplace services stagnated at 19% growth in FY24 after peaking at 188% in FY22. Together, these services contribute just 13.4% to revenue but remain vital for profitability, the brokerage said. Meanwhile, Nykaa's 27 owned brands are making progress but face hurdles. In BPC, GMV contribution rose from 11.1% in FY22 to 13.1% in FY24, though dependence on third-party brands hampers pricing power. Fashion lags further, with GMV declining from 12.9% in FY23 to 12.7% in FY24 and YoY growth stalling at 1.7% in 2QFY25. Scaling owned brands is essential to reduce reliance and improve margins, it added. Discover the latest Business News, Budget 2025 News, Sensex, and Nifty updates.

Avenue Supermarts (DMart),"DMart share price skids 5%, slips below ₹4,000 mark after Q4 business update",https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/dmart-share-price-skids-5-slips-below-rs-4-000-mark-after-q4-business-update-11743738799735.html,"Stock market today: Shares of Avenue Supermarts, which operates the retail chain DMart, tumbled 5% in the trading session on Friday, April 04, to slip below the ₹4,000 mark, reaching ₹3,946 apiece. This decline came following the company's March 2025 quarter (Q4FY25) business update, which fell short of analysts' expectations. In an exchange filing on Thursday, the company reported standalone revenue from operations of ₹14,462 crore for the March quarter, reflecting an increase of over 16.67% from ₹12,393 crore in the same quarter of the previous fiscal year (Q4FY24). During the quarter, the company opened 28 new stores—the highest quarterly addition in the last four years. With these new openings, the total store count has reached 415. Overall, the company has added 50 stores in FY25 (which is one of its key metrics), which is higher than 41 stores in FY24 and 40 stores in FY23. The FY25 store addition count also came in higher than analysts' estimates of 40. Earlier, in its annual investors’ day, the company had guided that the store count addition would, over the long term, sustain a 10-15% CAGR. Meanwhile, the company reported weaker-than-expected results for the December quarter, as rising Q-commerce activity continued to affect store performance in metro cities—though the impact was less severe than in Q2FY25. Earlier, in its Q3 results update report, Axis Securities stated that the company will continue to face challenges in optimising its overall store metrics in the near term due to several factors, such as increasing competition from both organized players (Reliance, Star Bazaar, Zudio) and online players (Zepto, Blinkit, Instamart), resulting in erosion of market share in metros and smaller towns. Further, it noted that higher discounts to mitigate the impact of rising competition will affect the overall profitability of the company. Additionally, discretionary demand continues to remain subdued, with a meaningful recovery anticipated only from FY26 onwards. Larger and newer stores also have longer gestation periods, thereby impacting the overall store performance, it added. The company shares have recovered 20% in March after losing 33% in 5 months. At current levels, the stock is trading 32% lower from its peak of ₹5900 apiece, which it attained in October 2021. Analysts noted that recent fundraising by the top three quick commerce players has significantly intensified competition. While they believe DMart’s value-driven model can coexist with the convenience-led model of quick commerce in the long run, heightened pricing pressure may weigh on DMart’s growth and margins in the near term.

Avenue Supermarts (DMart),DMart shares dip 5% to 3-month low as analysts remain cautious after Q2 business update,https://www.livemint.com/market/dmart-shares-dip-5-to-3-month-low-as-analysts-remain-cautious-after-q2-business-update-11728019285386.html,"Shares of Avenue Supermarts, which operates the retail chain DMart, tumbled 5% in the trading session on Friday, 4 October, to a three-month low of ₹4,703 apiece. This decline came following the company's September 2024 quarter (Q2FY25) business update, which fell short of analysts' expectations. In an exchange filing on Thursday, the company reported standalone revenue from operations of ₹14,050.32 crore for the September quarter, reflecting an increase of over 14.2% from ₹12,307.72 crore in the same quarter of the previous fiscal year (Q2FY24). The company recorded revenue of ₹10,384.66 crore in Q2 FY23 and ₹7,649.64 crore in Q2 FY22. As of September 30, 2024, the total number of stores operated by the company stood at 377. Following the company's Q2 business update, global brokerage firm Citi maintained its 'sell' rating on the stock with a target price of ₹3,350. The 14.2% year-on-year (YoY) Q2 revenue growth fell short of Citi's estimate of 19%. Further, the revenue per store showed a 2.9% CAGR over five years, reflecting only a 2.2% YoY growth compared to Citi's projection of 6.5%. The brokerage remained cautious on the stock, given its current valuation. Similarly, Goldman Sachs also continued with its 'sell' rating on the stock with a target price of ₹4,050. The brokerage notes a significant moderation in growth, which appears to be driven by a slowdown in same-store sales growth (SSSG). This slowdown is likely influenced by the rapid expansion of quick commerce players. Additionally, the brokerage highlighted that the store addition target may be at risk and has adjusted its FY25/26/27 earnings per share estimates down by 2% to reflect lower-than-expected revenue growth. Morgan Stanley maintained an 'overweight' rating on the stock with a target price of ₹5,769, highlighting that while the standalone Q2 revenue did not meet estimates, operational metrics showed improvement, albeit at a slower rate. Similarly, Macquarie also holds an 'overweight' rating on the stock, with a target price of ₹5,600 per share. In its August report, Bernstein maintained an ‘overweight’ rating on the stock with a target price of ₹6,300. It highlighted that DMart stands to benefit from rising incomes and the ongoing shift from unorganised to organised retail, positioning itself as the most efficient player in this sector. It believes that DMart possesses the key attributes to enhance consumer engagement within its touchpoints and has access to a substantial total addressable market (TAM) of $600 billion as a potential growth arena. The company in the June quarter reported a consolidated net profit of ₹773.8 crore for the first quarter of 2024-25, marking a 17.5% increase from ₹658.8 crore in the same period last year. The company's consolidated revenue from operations also saw a YoY rise of 18.6%, reaching ₹14,069.1 crore, up from ₹11,865.4 crore. The stock began its upward momentum in February 2024, increasing by 22% to date. However, it continues to trade at a 20% discount to its record peak of ₹5,900, which it reached in October 2021.

Avenue Supermarts, the operator of DMart, reported a 14 percent year-on-year growth in standalone revenues to Rs 14,050 crore for the quarter ended September 2024. However, several analysts highlighted concerns over the pace of growth. Morgan Stanley remained 'Overweight' on Avenue Supermarts with a target price of Rs 5,769 as it noted that while standalone Q2 revenue fell short of estimates, operational metrics improved, albeit at a slower pace. The growth trend was unexpectedly weaker, prompting the brokerage to await further clarity from the management during the upcoming Q2 results on the reasons behind the slower growth. Follow our market blog to catch all the live action Macquarie continued to rate DMart as 'Outperform' and has set a target price of Rs 5,600. Although sales growth has slowed compared to Q1 levels, store additions also slightly missed expectations. Macquarie anticipates a sequential moderation in gross margins due to changes in the product mix. Goldman Sachs, meanwhile, retained a 'Sell' rating with a target price of Rs 4,050. The firm highlighted a sharp slowdown in growth, likely affected by the rise of quick commerce (Q-Commerce). Growth moderation is attributed to a slowdown in Same Store Sales Growth (SSSG), leading to a 2 percent reduction in FY26 and FY27 EPS estimates. As of September 30, the Radhakishan Damani-owned company operated a total of 377 stores across the country. The company had opened six new stores during the quarter. It aims to add 45 stores in FY25 with the medium-term band at 45-60 stores per annum. However, analysts at Goldman Sachs flagged risks in store expansions. Citi is also bearish on DMart with a 'Sell' rating and a target price of Rs 3,350 per share. The brokerage believes throughput is being negatively impacted by an unfavourable product mix and store additions, with six new stores added during the quarter. Given the risks surrounding store expansions and earnings, Citi remains cautious at the current valuation.

The stock has risen 21 percent so far this year, slightly outperforming Nifty's returns of 16 percent.

It reported a net profit of Rs 690 crore in the corresponding quarter. Its consolidated revenue grew 17.6 percent at Rs 15,973 cr vs Rs 13,572 in the corresponding quarter. The company reported its EBITDA margin at 7.6 percent in Q3 FY25 vs 8.3 percent in Q3 FY24. PAT margin also decreased 5 percent vs 5.5 percent YoY. Avenue Supermarts' total expenses in the December quarter rose to ₹15,001.64 crore from ₹12,656.46 crore in the same period last year. Avenue Supermarts CEO and Managing Director Neville Noronha said, ""The Q3 FY 2025 same-store revenue growth for 2 years and older stores was at 8.3 per cent. We continue to see the increased intensity in discounting in the FMCG category and the consequent impact to high turnover per square feet stores in metro towns"". However, this quarter, the impact has relatively reduced compared to the previous quarter (Q2 FY2025). On its online ordering service DMart Ready, Noronha said it grew by 21.5 per cent in the first nine months of FY 2025. ""In the rapidly evolving dynamics of the grocery e-commerce market, we are seeing significantly more demand for home delivery compared to the pick-up point, and hence, we continue to align our business to that extent,"" he added. Now, D-Mart's home delivery business far exceeds our pick-up point sales contribution, he noted. ""We will continue to provide both channels of delivery as an option to our shoppers in select towns. In several towns, we now only operate Home Delivery as a delivery channel,"" Noronha said. As of December 31, 2024, the company had 387 operating stores with a retail business area of 16.1 million sq.

The company's revenue during the quarter also fell 11.4 percent to Rs 5,306.2 crore compared to the September quarter 2019 but there was 36.6 percent sequential growth. ""FMCG and staples demand remains robust. September 2020 sales of all stores exceeded September 2019 sales for FMCG and staples while general merchandise and garments did lesser sales in the same period,"" CEO & Managing Director Neville Noronha said. However, ""discretionary consumption has seen significant improvement over Q1FY21. We were at 22.7 percent revenue contribution from general merchandise and apparel business in Q2FY21 as compared to the usual 27.3 percent contribution for the year. Almost all of the shopping in Q1FY21 was need-based and essential in nature. In light of that, Q2FY21 sales contribution from general merchandise and apparel is encouraging,"" he added. Other income also supported profitability, rising significantly to Rs 52.2 crore in the September quarter from Rs 8.1 crore YoY. At the operating level, consolidated earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) dropped 36 percent to Rs 329.5 crore and margin contracted 240 bps to 6.2 percent compared to thecorresponding quarter of last fiscal. ""Overall better-than-expected performance led by a quicker normalisation of overall business with a strong sequential recovery. We expected a decline of 15/47/49 percent for revenue/EBITDA/PAT respectively,"" Himanshu Nayyar, Lead Analyst–Institutional Equities, Yes Securities told Moneycontrol. Gross margins were in line with expectations at 14 percent, given the inferior mix in the favour of FMCG and staples while EBITDA margins were impacted due to negative operating leverage, he said. The company said it continued to focus on new stores and has opened six DMart stores in the quarter. ""We have closed two of Mumbai stores for customers and converted them into fulfillment centers (FC) for our ecommerce business."" The stock gained only 5.2 percent during theSeptember quarter and 8 percent year-to-date. After the recent underperformance, the stock is currently trading at 55x FY22E P/E and 35x EV/EBITDA, Nayyar said. ""While we have been negative on the stock given the risks to FY21 earnings and medium-term risk of multiple de-rating, the better-than-expected recovery trajectory and the correction in valuation multiples makes us turn more constructive on the stock. Increased focus and increasing traction in DMart Ready is another positive sign,"" he added. Discover the latest Business News, Budget 2025 News, Sensex, and Nifty updates.

Avenue Supermarts (DMart),"D-Mart operator Avenue Supermarts surges around 4%, but Citi maintains 'Sell'; here is why",https://www.zeebiz.com/market-news/news-dmart-share-price-nse-bse-avenue-supermarts-q2-business-update-citi-says-sell-257453,"D-Mart share price Q2 business update, Avenue Supermarts share price NSE BSE: Shares of Avenue Supermarts, the entity that owns and operates the supermarket chain D-Mart, surged as much as 3.82 per cent to hit a high of Rs 3,864.90 apiece on the BSE in the early trade on Wednesday, October 4, a day after the company shared its Q2FY24 business update. The stock finally ended at Rs 3,871, up 3.99 per cent. The company said its revenue during the July-September period of the current fiscal came in at Rs 12,307.72 crore, up 18.5 per cent against Rs 10,384.66 crore registered in the corresponding quarter of the previous fiscal. The total number of stores as of September 30, 2023, stood at 336. Shares of the Radhakishan Damani-founded company, which was once a solid wealth creator, have declined more than 13 per cent over the past 12 months. In comparison, the benchmark S&P BSE Sensex has gained over 12 per cent during the window. Global brokerage Citi, in its research report, post-Q2 business update, said that there are no signs of throughput recovery yet. The brokerage believes that revenue/sq ft continues to be impacted by an inferior product mix. It further highlighted that the company added only nine stores during the quarter and that it remains cautious of the stock at its current value. However, Macquarie has maintained an 'overweight' rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 4,550. The brokerage notes that the company's Q2 store additions and sales growth are broadly in line with their estimates. Further, its four-year sales compound annual growth rate (CAGR) has risen marginally from Q1 levels. The marginal uptick in sales momentum was led by a gradual recovery in the high-margin apparel segment, the brokerage adds. The retail chain D-Mart operator Avenue Supermarts reported a 2.46 per cent rise in its consolidated net profit at Rs 658.71 crore for the April-June 2023 quarter, as lower sales of apparel and general merchandise impacted margins. The company had posted a net profit of Rs 642.89 crore in the corresponding quarter a year ago, said Avenue Supermarts in a BSE filing. Its revenue from operations was up 18.20 per cent to Rs 11,865.44 crore during the quarter under review as against Rs 10,038.07 crore in the same quarter last fiscal.

Avenue Supermarts (DMart),"Avenue Supermarts Q2 underwhelms on stiff competition from online rivals; shares crack 8%
",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/avenue-supermarts-q2-underwhelms-as-competitive-intensity-lower-sssg-drags-12841205.html,"DMart parent Avenue Supermarts earnings show for the quarter ended September left brokerages disappointed, as the revenue and net profit fell below expectations. The retail major's net profit for the second quarter of the current financial year rose by 5.8 percent on-year, reaching Rs 659.6 crore, compared to Rs 623.6 crore in the same period last year. For the quarter, Avenue Supermarts revenue rose by 14.4 percent YoY to Rs 14,444.5 crore, up from Rs 12,624.4 crore year-on-year. The Street showed its disappointment in the results. At 9.20 am, DMart shares cracked eight percent to quote Rs 4,210.55 on the NSE. According to international brokerage Bernstein, the biggest miss for Avenue Supermarts was revenue growth, which was the slowest in four years. The like-for-like growth was the slowest in three years. The management noted that the stores/operations in metro cities, including the online offering DMart Ready, were impacted by online grocery format players, including quick commerce players. Additionally, employee costs were higher-than-expected as a result of DMart's continuing efforts to improve service levels and building capability for the future, noted Nuvama Institutional Equities. Average bill size, which increased during the pandemic owing to stockpiling, has remained sticky, even as DMart added more stores in new geographies. Average bills cut per store per day, which is a reflection of footfall per store per day, has also grown slightly. ""Combining the aforementioned two observations implies the average visitation has not dipped, but part of the buying has shifted to other platforms, such as quick commerce,"" said Nuvama. During FY12-20, DMart sustained a consistent SSSG (same store sales growth) above the 10 percent print. However, that has come off with older stores maturing. For Q2, the like-for-like revenue growth for the same cohort of stores was at 5.5 percent. DMart can return to seeing 20 percent growth on fast store/retail area addition, said Bernstein. If the company pivots its area of focus to 4-6 hour delivery and sees reduced competitive intensity from quick-commerce in metro cities, it could see the same growth rate again. These factors might take 3-5 quarters to impact DMart. For the quarter, DMart opened six stores, as compared to nine in the same quarter of the previous year, taking taking the total store count to 377. ""DMart has a pattern of opening more stores in the second half than in the first half. We are building in 45 stores for FY25, which seems achievable as per the commentary as well as the trailing 12 months’ running rate,"" said Nuvama Institutional Equities. Should you buy, sell or hold DMart shares? Hong Kong-based brokerage CLSA said the net profit was notably below estimates, but the firm is making an appropriate pivot to private labels, which will place it well to meet future competition. Private labels are brands which are owned and sold solely by the owner of the retail store. As a result, CLSA maintained its 'outperform' rating on DMart. Global broking firm JPMorgan slashed its target price on Avenue Supermarts, downgrading the firm to a 'neutral' rating. ""Expanding scale for quick-commerce may continue to weigh on stock performance, depsite the recent share price correction. Also, the extent of SSSG moderation surprised us,"" said the brokerage. It lowered its SSSG/revenue forecast by 4-6 percent over FY25-26. Building in the impact of online grocery players and weakness in DMart’s H1FY25 showing, we are cutting FY25E PAT by 7 percent, said Nuvama. This yields a revised target price of Rs 4,500, down from Rs 5,183 per share.

On January 20, Nazara Technologies announced that it is buying intellectual property (IP) rights of two mobile gaming titles - CATS: Crash Arena and King of Thieves - from Barcelona-based game developer and publisher ZeptoLab for Rs 66.6 crore ($7.7 million) in an all-cash deal. The two games reported $6.1 million in revenues in the calendar year 2024. Through this acquisition, Nazara will own the game IPs and will also publish the games under the “Nazara Publishing” banner, it said. In September, Nazara made its largest bet to date by announcing an investment of Rs 982 crore in Moonshine Technology, the parent firm of online poker platform PokerBaazi. The firm also acquired UK-based gaming studio Fusebox Games for Rs 228 crore in an all-cash deal and purchased a 15.86 percent stake in esports community platform Stan for Rs 18.4 crore in cash through a secondary transaction from existing shareholders. Nazara is also buying remaining stakes in its subsidiaries Paper Boat Apps, which owns the gamified learning app Kiddopia, and Nextwave Multimedia, a mobile-gaming studio, to take 100 percent ownership. These deals are part of the company's new operating model, implemented last year, which aims to bring the core gaming business into the parent entity. This will increase the parent firm's revenue and free cash flow, which can then be deployed for both organic and inorganic growth. In an interview to Moneycontrol in May 2024, founder Nitish Mittersain said he expects the core gaming business to become the largest revenue generator for the company over the next two or three years. Nazara Technologies is also partnering with Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) to launch an in-game monetisation platform, gCommerce, designed to help game developers boost their monetisation efforts. Slated for a Q1- FY26 rollout, the platform will enable developers to integrate e-commerce within games, thereby providing them with new revenue streams.

Dilip Buildcon,Dilip Buildcon Allots 8.39 Lakh Shares on Warrant Conversion,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/dilip-buildcon-allots-8-39-lakh-shares-on-warrant-conversion-alpha-article-13137068.html,"Dilip Buildcon Limited, a prominent infrastructure company, announced on June 18, 2025, that its Warrants Committee has approved the allotment of 8,39,352 equity shares of face value Rs. 10 each. This allotment, conducted at an issue price of Rs. 328.05 per share (including a premium of Rs. 318.05 per share), follows the exercise and conversion of an equal number of convertible warrants by warrant holders. The move increases the company's paid-up share capital and provides it with additional funds.Impact on Equity Share Capital (Post Allotment)ParticularsPre-Allotment (Number of Shares)Pre-Allotment (Value in Rs.)Shares AllottedValue of Shares Allotted (Rs.)Post-Allotment (Number of Shares)Post-Allotment (Value in Rs.)Issued Capital16,16,05,4811,61,60,54,810 (Rs. 161.60 crore)8,39,35283,93,520 (Rs. 83.93 lakh)16,24,44,8331,62,44,48,330 (Rs. 162.44 crore)Subscribed and Paid-up Capital16,16,05,4811,61,60,54,810 (Rs. 161.60 crore)8,39,35283,93,520 (Rs. 83.93 lakh)16,24,44,8331,62,44,48,330 (Rs. 162.44 crore)Details of the AllotmentThe Warrants Committee of Dilip Buildcon's Board of Directors convened on June 18, 2025, and approved the allotment of 8,39,352 equity shares. These shares, each with a face value of Rs. 10, were issued at a price of Rs. 328.05 per share. This issue price includes a significant premium of Rs. 318.05 per share over the face value. The allotment was made against the receipt of the balance subscription amount of Rs. 246.03 per warrant, which constitutes 75% of the issue price. This tranche of payment aggregated to Rs. 20,65,05,772.56 (approximately Rs. 20.65 crore). The initial 25% of the issue price, amounting to Rs. 82.02 per warrant (totaling Rs. 6,88,43,651.04 or approximately Rs. 6.88 crore), had been received by the company at the time of the original warrant allotment. Therefore, the total consideration received by Dilip Buildcon for these 8,39,352 converted warrants amounts to Rs. 27,53,49,423.60 (approximately Rs. 27.53 crore). This conversion pertains to 8,39,352 convertible warrants, which, as per the company's disclosure, were the balance warrants due for conversion from a larger pool. This action is in continuation of a prior announcement dated June 13, 2025, which concerned the allotment of 1,53,90,510 equity shares through warrant conversions.Impact on Equity Share CapitalAs a direct result of this allotment, Dilip Buildcon's equity share capital has expanded. The issued, subscribed, and paid-up equity share capital of the company has increased from 16,16,05,481 equity shares to 16,24,44,833 equity shares. In terms of value (at a face value of Rs. 10 per share), the issued capital has risen from Rs. 1,61,60,54,810 (approximately Rs. 161.60 crore) to Rs. 1,62,44,48,330 (approximately Rs. 162.44 crore). The subscribed and paid-up capital figures have seen an identical increase.Allottees and Issuance TypeThe 8,39,352 newly allotted equity shares were issued on a preferential allotment basis through private placement to two institutional investors. The details of the allottees are as follows:Quanterra Stratergies LLP: Allotted 1,89,508 equity shares.Spectrum Edge LLP: Allotted 6,49,844 equity shares.This type of issuance allows companies to raise capital from a select group of investors, often more quickly than through a public offering.Regulatory Framework and Shareholder RightsDilip Buildcon has confirmed that this allotment and conversion process has been carried out in strict compliance with the provisions of the SEBI (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2018 (commonly known as ICDR Regulations), as well as the terms and conditions stipulated at the time of the warrant allotment. The company also referred to the SEBI Disclosure Circular (SEBI/HO/CFD/PoD2/CIR/P/0155 dated November 11, 2024) in its regulatory filings. Crucially for all shareholders, the newly allotted equity shares will rank pari passu with the existing equity shares of the company in all respects. This means that the new shareholders will have the same rights as existing ones, including rights related to the payment of dividends and voting rights at shareholder meetings.Procedural AspectsThe decision to allot these shares was taken at a meeting of the Warrants Committee of the Board of Directors, which was held on June 18, 2025. The meeting commenced at 10:00 AM and concluded at 10:30 AM on the same day. In adherence to corporate governance norms and SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 2015 (as amended), Dilip Buildcon has also announced the closure of its trading window. This restriction applies to all insiders, designated persons, their immediate relatives, connected persons, fiduciaries, and intermediaries. The trading window will remain closed for 48 hours from the time this information is made generally available to the public, to prevent any potential misuse of unpublished price-sensitive information.Context of Warrant ConversionConvertible warrants are financial instruments that give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to purchase a company's equity shares at a predetermined price (the exercise price) within a specified timeframe. Companies often issue warrants as part of a fundraising strategy, sometimes attached to other securities like bonds or offered to existing shareholders. For investors, warrants offer the potential to profit if the company's stock price rises above the exercise price. For the company, warrant conversions lead to an infusion of equity capital, strengthening the balance sheet without immediate large-scale dilution that might occur with a direct equity offering. The staggered nature of capital inflow (initial payment for warrants, then balance on conversion) can also align with the company's funding needs over time.Market ConsiderationsThe allotment of new equity shares, such as this conversion by Dilip Buildcon, increases the total number of outstanding shares. This can lead to a dilution of Earnings Per Share (EPS) in the immediate term, as the company's net profit is now divided among a larger number of shares. However, the impact on long-term shareholder value depends on how effectively the company utilizes the capital raised. If the funds contribute to profitable growth projects, debt reduction leading to lower interest costs, or other value-enhancing activities, the EPS dilution can be offset over time. The market's reaction to such corporate actions is typically observed in the trading activity of the company's stock. Dilip Buildcon's shares trade on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) under the symbol DBL and on the BSE Limited under the symbol 540047. The successful conversion of warrants can also be interpreted as a positive signal, indicating that warrant holders (in this case, Quanterra Stratergies LLP and Spectrum Edge LLP) have confidence in the company's future prospects and find it beneficial to convert their warrants into equity ownership. The infusion of Rs. 27.53 crore will bolster the company's financial resources for its ongoing and future infrastructure projects.

The infrastructure firm reported a consolidated net profit at Rs 5.34 crore in Q4FY24, against a loss of Rs 73.2 crore in the same period of the previous fiscal.

As part of the deal, Alpha and its other entities will pick up a 10% stake in Dilip Buildcon via warrants at ₹328.05 per warrant. This will translate into an infusion of ₹530 crore into the company via warrants. Separately Alpha will also pick up a 26% stake in 18 road assets under the InvIT route. The remaining 74% stake will be held by DBL. Dilip Buildcon expects Alpha to bring in ₹700-800 crore worth of capital through warrants and InvIT during fiscal year 2024 and the remaining ₹1200-1300 crore in FY2025. ""DBL is getting ₹2000 crore capital and 4000 crore worth of invIT units which will translate into cash of ₹400 crore per year. Our idea is seeing the EPC business giving us regular business, taking the invested capital back into the company and setting up a long term revenue stream through our InvIT. As our EPC business keeps growing and PPP projects keep on increasing, we will keep adding more units to this one InvIT,"" said Rohan Suryavanshi, head of strategy, DBL during the analysts' call on Wednesday. The fundraising is in line with Dilip Buildcon's overall debt reduction plan that was laid down earlier. It plans to be a zero-net debt company by fiscal year 2025. ""We have reduced ₹300 crore of debt from FY23 levels and our own target to reduce ₹800-1000 crore from FY23 to FY24 as stated earlier. That will take our net debt to ₹1300-1500 crore by end of this financial year. Our target is to make DBL a net debt free company by next financial year,"" said Suryavanshi. ""We have taken a conservative approach going forward. We will focus on improving cash flows, reducing capex and monetising our assets,"" he added. Dilip Buildcon’s order book stood at ₹23,988 crore at the end of June quarter, and this comprises roads and highways, mining, irrigation, water supply, tunnel projects, metro projects and special bridge projects. Suryavanshi said the company is not looking to grow at a pace of 25% year-on-year. ""The order book will grow commensurately to what revenue we want to do. We will look at having ₹10,000 crore of order every year,"" he added. ""Road sector is looking robust. Good investments are coming in for the companies and projects in this sector. Activity is happening on the ham and EPC.

Dilip Buildcon,"Dilip Buildcon, a top Indian highway builder, sees Infra push doubling sales",https://www.livemint.com/news/india/dilip-buildcon-india-s-top-highway-builder-sees-infra-push-doubling-sales-11614682356471.html,"Dilip Buildcon Ltd., one of the top highway builders in India, expects revenue to double in the next 4-5 years on an infrastructure push by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government, Rohan Suryavanshi, the company’s head of strategy & planning, said in an interview with Bloomberg TV. “We should be looking at 15%-20% growth year-on-year, which will lead us to double our sales in next 4-5 years,” he said. “We should be looking at an increasing order book.” India announced the highest ever outlay of ₹1.18 trillion ($16 billion) for the development of highways and roads in its 2021-22 budget. A custom Bloomberg gauge of Indian road builders has gained 27.6% since the budget was presented on Feb. 1 as compared to a gain of 2.99% in the benchmark BSE Sensex. Dilip Buildcon has jumped 53% during the period. The Bhopal-based engineering procurement and construction company has focused on selling assets as soon as they near completion. The company has monetized 29 road assets in the last three years, including the sale of five under-construction road assets in August 2019 to Cube Highways and Infrastructure, a Singapore-based firm -- backed by investors including the World Bank’s financial arm, Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and I Squared Capital. It is now in talks to sell seven under-construction road assets to a global investor. The company has signed a term sheet, completed due diligence and expects to sign a sales-purchase agreement soon, Suryavanshi said, without divulging more information about the investor. “Global investors do come in at early stages of construction but the money starts coming only when assets are completed,” he said. The highway builder expects to receive ₹2,000 crore from the monetization of the Cube Highways deal and the one being negotiated as construction is completed over the next two years. Meanwhile, the company has added ten new roads in its portfolio and will also seek to sell them, Suryavanshi said in a separate call today. Global yield hungry investors including Macquarie Group, GIC, The Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Cube Highways have been chasing opportunities in India’s highway sector either through direct acquisitions or through investment in private road trusts and road builders. India’s highway sector construction and order activity picked up this financial year, which ends on March 31, despite the pandemic, according to government data. Apart from roads, Dilip Buildcon will look at forming partnerships with global investors for other infrastructure assets, Suryavanshi said, without elaborating on the type of assets. In recent years, Dilip Buildcon has received several orders for assets including railways, metro rail, tunnels, bridges and airports. Suryavanshi said that the company’s debt level had seen a slight increase last year following the pandemic but it aims to bring down its debt to equity ratio to 0.3%-0.5% from around 0.8% currently with asset sales and internal accruals.

Dilip Buildcon,"Dilip Buildcon to sell 24 road assets to Shrem Group for Rs 1,600 crore",https://www.financialexpress.com/business/industry-dilip-buildcon-to-sell-24-road-assets-to-shrem-group-for-rs-1600-crore-824029/,"Dilip Buildcon (DBL) said on Thursday it has signed an agreement with the Chhatwal Group Trust (Shrem Group) to sell 24 of its road assets. The sale is for 14 operational projects and 10 under-construction projects, for which DBL will receive about Rs 1,600 crore over the next two years. Six of these projects were recently awarded to the company under the hybrid annuity model (HAM). As of June 30, 2017, the company had already invested Rs 682 crore across all 24 projects. The company will continue to invest in the under-construction projects towards the equity portion that is required for the hybrid annuity projects. Under HAM, which was introduced in H2 of 2016, road developers need to invest 60% of the project cost (mix of debt and equity) while 40% is given as a grant by the government. Rohan Suryavanshi, director, strategy and planning, DBL, told FE the company would receive an additional Rs 4,000 crore over the next 15 years from Shrem for the operations and maintenance of the assets. “The projects already completed were part of a stable portfolio of annuity assets. For the projects that are under construction, we will continue to construct these and also maintain them, thereafter.” DBL’s consolidated debt at the moment stands at about Rs 1,700 crore. Suryanvanshi said the company would repay its lenders as well as invest in bidding for more projects. He said, “We will take a decision shortly on how best to utilise the proceeds.” This is Shrem Group’s first foray into the roads sector. The Mumbai-headquartered company has two hotels in Goa — the Novotel Goa Shrem Resort Hotel and Grand Mercure Goa Shrem Resort. It has real estate projects in Mumbai, Alibaug and Karjat (in Maharashtra), Delhi and Neemrana in Rajasthan. Delhi’s strict fuel ban on older vehicles has sparked criticism from various parties, with Trinamool Congress member Saket Gokhale urging the government to withdraw the policy. The ban, which will impact over 62 lakh vehicles, is being viewed as a ploy to benefit automakers and corporate interests. Other politicians have also slammed the move, accusing the BJP of making empty promises.",positive

Analysts at Nuvama note that BEL remains one of the biggest defence electronics manufacturers and compared to others in the space, has better visibility of elevated operating margins on higher indigenisation efforts, cost efficiencies, and a better product mix. Robust order book and project mix sensitivity: Brokerages believe that BEL’s strong order book of Rs 71,700 crore provides strong revenue visibility. However, earnings are closely tied to the timely execution of key defence programmes such as QRSAM, MRSAM, LRSAM (different types of surface-to-air missiles) and electronic warfare systems. Push for indigenisation and margin expansion potential: Continued efforts to indigenise modules, subsystems, and key components are expected to support long-term margin expansion. High base: Analysts at both Philip Capital and Nuvama note that Q4FY25 revenue growth is likely to be muted at just 4 percent YoY due to a high base. Despite revenue momentum, EBITDA margins are expected to remain range-bound, reflecting steady but constrained profitability in the near term. Order pipeline and working capital management: Analysts at both Philip Capital and Nuvama observed that management commentary on the large order pipeline will be a key factor. Additionally, MOSL underlines the importance of increasing export contribution and maintaining a healthy working capital cycle, especially considering BEL's significant government-linked receivables.

IRB Infrastructure,IRB Infra stock drops 4% on subdued Q2 earnings show,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/irb-infra-stock-drops-4-on-subdued-q2-earnings-show-12855895.html,"Shares of IRB Infrastructure Developers dropped as much as 4 percent on October 31 bogged down by the company's subdued earnings performance for the July-September quarter. At 10.20 am, shares of IRB Infra were trading at Rs 52.19 on the NSE. Including today's fall, the stock is now down over 21 percent in the last three months. The company's revenue fell a little over 9 percent on year to Rs 158.6 crore, compared to Rs 174.5 crore in the same quarter of the previous fiscal. The decline in revenue was on account of a heavy monsoon season. Despite a fall in revenue, the company reported a 4.3 percent increase in consolidated net profit, at Rs 99.8 crore, up from Rs 95.7 crore in the same quarter last year, supported by higher operating margins. Follow our market blog to catch all the live action The operational performance also improved as EBITDA margins expanded to 48.3 percent, up from 45.6 percent a year earlier, reflecting efficiency gains that helped mitigate the challenges posed by lower revenue. As of the end of the September quarter, IRB Infra's order book stood at Rs 3.26 lakh crore, with the Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) segment contributing 12.3 percent (Rs 40,000 crore) and Operations and Maintenance (O&M) contributing 87.7 percent (Rs 2.86 lakh crore). Furthermore, the company anticipates significant ordering from the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) in the near future, given that there are 6 to 7 Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) projects and 4 Toll-Operate-Transfer (TOT) projects lined up for bidding. Moreover, over the longer term, the company is also expecting opportunities under PPP mode for BOT projects worth Rs 2 lakh crore. On the back of IRB Infra's improving outlook on ordering and likely better toll growth in H2 FY25, brokerage firm HDFC Securities retained its 'add' rating on the stock with a price target of Rs 69.

IRB Infrastructure,IRB Infrastructure Developers share price jumps over 4% after promoter's stock buying move. Details here,https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/irb-infrastructure-developers-share-price-jumps-over-4-after-promoters-stock-buying-move-details-here-11737101369130.html,"Shares of IRB Infrastructure Developers witnessed a strong uptick on Friday, January 17, climbing over 4 per cent after the company’s promoter disclosed the release of a substantial share encumbrance. This development bolstered investor confidence, reflecting positively on the stock's performance in an otherwise weak market. The rally in IRB Infrastructure’s stock was triggered by a filing submitted by Sudha Dattaray, one of the company’s promoters. The disclosure, made under Regulation 31(2) of SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations, 2011, revealed the release of encumbrance on 28.4 lakh shares. These shares represented approximately 0.047 per cent of IRB Infrastructure's total equity. Dattaray holds a total of 50.59 lakh shares in the company, equating to 0.08 per cent of the total equity. Of these, 35.90 lakh shares, or 0.059 per cent of the equity, were pledged. The latest disclosure confirms that the majority of the pledged shares have now been released, leaving only 7.5 lakh shares—or a mere 0.01 per cent of the company’s total equity—still encumbered. The filing indicated that the shares were initially pledged for personal borrowing purposes. Jio Financial Services was named as the entity in whose favour the shares were encumbered. The release of such a significant portion of the pledged shares signals a positive move by the promoter, alleviating concerns about financial stress or over-leverage. The release of encumbrances often indicates reduced financial obligations on the part of promoters, which is generally seen as a positive signal by the market. The stock climbed as much as 4.2 per cent to its day's high of ₹54.78. It is now 30 per cent away from its 52-week high of ₹78.05, hit in June 2024. Meanwhile, the stock has advanced 22 per cent from its 52-week low of ₹44.96, recorded in January 2024. In the last one year, the stock has gained 15.5 per cent while lost 4.5 per cent in January so far after 2 straight months of gains. IRB Infrastructure Developers reported a 4 per cent increase in consolidated net profit to ₹99.86 crore for Q2FY25, compared to ₹95.74 crore in the year-ago period.

IRB Infrastructure Developers, an engineering and development firm, has also announced a 10:1 stock split. IRB Infra has set Wednesday, February 22, 2023 as the record date to determine shareholders' eligibility for the aforementioned corporate action. Find out from the experts of various brokerage companies what individuals should do with the stock after the stock split announcement and the net profit double in Q3. The research analysts of Kotak Securities said in a note that “IRB’s results reflected improved performance across EPC and toll collections. Healthy toll collection and commencement of work at Ganga Expressway to scale up consolidated revenues further. Ordering activity has remained weak for the sector. We cut estimates by 3% on lower ordering assumptions and retain an SoTP-based Fair Value to Rs340 on roll forward to March 2025 estimates. We cut our estimates by 3% to take into account lower ordering and amortization charges. Net of roll forward, we maintain our Fair Value of Rs340 based on SoTP, valuing the core business at 7X EV/EBITDA on March 2025 estimates. Retain BUY.” The research analysts of HDFC Securities said “IRB reported revenue/EBITDA/APAT of INR 15.1/7.4/1.4bn, (behind)/ahead of our estimates by (0.5)/7.1/32%. EBITDA margin came in at 49.2%, beating our estimate of 45.7%. Consequently, APAT came in at INR 1.4bn (+94.5%/+3.2x YoY/QoQ a 32% beat). IRB refinanced the project loan for another private InvIT SPV through the issuance of NCDs with fixed coupon rate of 8.9% p.a. As of Dec’22, the order book (OB) stood at INR 191.2bn (~3.2x of FY23E revenue). The consolidated gross debt reduced to INR 126.7bn vs. INR 127.1bn, as of Sep’22. IRB expects to infuse equity of INR 2/7/2bn in Q4FY23/FY24/FY25. It guided for order inflow (OI) of INR 60-80bn for Q4FY23 and a construction revenue of INR 45bn for FY23. We maintain ADD rating on the stock with an increased SOTP target price of INR 306/sh as we roll forward to Dec-24 estimates. EPS change is reflective of a better margin on improved toll.” The research analysts of Motilal Oswal said “IRB’s order book is strong at INR191b (incl. O&M). IRB received appointed date for the Ganga Expressway project during 3QFY23. As some of these large projects move into execution, we expect EPC growth to improve going ahead. We increase our PAT estimates for FY23/FY24 by 3%/10%, respectively. We reiterate our Neutral rating with an SoTP-based TP of INR295.” The research analysts of Anand Rathi said “Construction at the recently appointed Ganga Expressway stabilising, and as the post-Q3 appointment of Chittor-Thachur hybrid annuities pave the way for this project to start contributing, the stage seems set for better scale in the immediate future. The current core-project OB, though, good for the near-term, needs to be augmented at the earliest. Management, citing healthy prospects, is sanguine of adding to keep growing. The BOT-toll division continues to benefit from rising traffic and periodic rate-revisions. The ongoing commitment to check capital intensity (and churn assets for more growth) stays, and the recent monetisation of a hybrid annuity, thus, is an augury. On the reassuring outlook, we retain our Hold rating, at a higher TP of Rs309 (on asset sale and raised estimates).” The research analysts of DAM Capital said “IRB is the only pure play road toll operator in the listed space. With the marquee new investors in company and deleveraging, we expect renewed investor interest in the sector and expect stock to re-rate over next few years. We expect growth aspirations to improve on back of large investors and a deleveraged balance sheet. Besides, the improving traffic on roads bodes well for the earnings. Increasing monetisation opportunities will further aid in increasing opportunity basket for company. We value its BOT business (including private INVIT) at Rs70bn, EPC business at Rs35bn and revise our SOTP based TP for IRB at Rs322. We maintain buy rating on stock with CMP Rs.290, with TP providing 11% upside.” The research analysts of Antique Stock Broking Ltd said “With improved credit rating, IRB Infrastructure Developers’ (IRB) finance expenses are lower than expected. And subsequently, the company is refinancing its debt. With progress on HAM project, IRB’s EBITDA margin narrows to 29%. Execution remains flat, given modest order backlog. With Modern Road Makers (MRM) execution on track, we retain our estimates. Using SoTP valuation, we value IRB at INR 329/share. We retain BUY.” On Friday, the shares of IRB Infrastructure Developers Limited closed on the NSE at ₹288.80 apiece, down by 1.05% from the previous close of ₹291.85. The stock recorded a total volume average of 1,122,195 shares and a delivery volume average of 57,557,382 shares or 51.29%. The stock touched a 52-week-high of ₹329.40 on (14-Dec-2022) and a 52-week-low of ₹178.90 on (20-Jun-2022).

Bikaji Foods posted a net profit of ₹28.6 crore in Q3FY25, marking a 39 percent year-on-year (YoY) decline from ₹46.6 crore in the corresponding quarter last year. The decline was largely attributed to weaker operational performance despite moderate revenue growth. Revenue increased 14.5 percent YoY to ₹714.9 crore, supported by a 3 percent rise in volumes. However, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) fell 26 percent YoY to ₹55.5 crore. The EBITDA margin contracted sharply by 425 basis points to 7.8 percent, primarily due to inflationary pressures and higher raw material costs. The ethnic snacks segment, which accounted for 62.1 percent of total revenue, witnessed a 10.5 percent YoY growth. The packaged sweets category recorded an 11.2 percent increase, contributing 18.1 percent to overall revenue. Meanwhile, western snacks revenue remained flat at 6.8 percent, whereas the papad segment posted 9.6 percent growth, making up 6 percent of total revenue. For the nine-month period ended December 31, revenue increased by 17.1 percent YoY to ₹2,008.2 crore, with a 10.9 percent rise in volumes. EBITDA for the period stood at ₹253.9 crore, reflecting a 12.6 percent margin, while profit after tax (PAT) came in at ₹154.4 crore, with a net margin of 7.7 percent. Basic earnings per share (EPS) for the period was ₹6.24. Following the earnings announcement, Bikaji Foods’ stock plunged 12.8 percent to an intra-day low of ₹638.10. The stock is now over 36 percent below its 52-week high of ₹1,005, which it hit in September 2024. However, it remains 34 percent above its 52-week low of ₹475.50, recorded in March 2024. Despite gaining 30 percent over the past year, the stock has been under pressure in recent months. It has declined nearly 5 percent so far in February, marking its fifth consecutive month of losses. In January alone, it shed over 11 percent. Catch all the Business News , Market News , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

Bikaji Foods,Bikaji says ‘not for sale’ amid investor interest in Indian snacks market,http://livemint.com/companies/news/bikaji-says-not-for-sale-amid-investor-interest-in-indian-snacks-market-buyout-offers-expand-business-ratan-agarwal-plan-11724824849193.html,"Indian snacks maker Bikaji Foods is ""not for sale"" and is instead on the prowl itself, aiming to cash in on the growing appetite for savoury brands in the world's most populous country, a top executive told Reuters. The Indian savoury snacks sector has ballooned in recent years as consumers splurge on packaged foods. ""Bikaji is not for sale. Whatever price someone offers, there are certain things that are not for sale,"" Chief Operating Officer Manoj Verma said earlier this month, without disclosing whether the company has received buyout offers. His comments came after India's Tata Group and a consortium including Blackstone and Singapore's GIC held acquisition talks with market leader Haldiram's. Shares in Bikaji, which is majority-owned by founder Shiv Ratan Agarwal and his family, have gained around 67% to value the company at $2.55 billion since Reuters reported on investor interest in Haldiram's last September. Haldiram's itself was in talks to acquire a majority stake in peer Prataap Snacks in January. ""Suddenly, this has become a hot space,"" Verma said, adding that he expects the entry of heavyweight investors to make the market more competitive and fuel further growth. Reuters reported in May that talks between Tata and Haldiram's had ended, while it is not immediately clear if other deal talks are still ongoing. Bikaji, which recently bought stakes in Bhujialalji and Ariba Foods, aims to make more acquisitions only if they could help expand distribution or boost its presence in the frozen-food market, he said, adding that it has a budget of 1 billion rupees to 1.5 billion rupees (around $12 million-$18 million) for the right target. The snacks maker, which brokerage Anand Rathi said is the third biggest Indian snacks brand behind Haldiram's and Balaji, is more focused on expanding its market share by 50 basis points every year from 9% currently. Verma expects Bikaji's revenue to rise 16%-17% in the current fiscal year from 23.29 billion rupees in the year ended March 31.

The focus markets include the states of UP, Punjab, Haryana, Chhattisgarh, Telangana, and Karnataka where the company is trying to establish and improve its presence.

The core markets contribute 71.5 percent of the revenues, focus markets contribute to 14 percent of the revenues, other markets form 11 percent and exports form 3.5 percent of the revenues, added the brokerage.

Bikaji Foods operated at a margin of 17 percent (incl. PLI benefits) for FY2024 with profit margins of 11.3 percent whereas Prataap Snacks operated at 8.7 percent with profit margins of 3.3 percent for FY2024. Bikaji Foods generated an ROE of 21.6 percent in FY2024 compared to that of 7.3 percent for Prataap Snacks. Bikaji Foods trades at a P/E of 63 compared to Prataap Snacks trading at a P/E of 38. Such disparity in margin profile and return ratios has led to the market giving a premium to Bikaji Foods, it rationaled. The brokerage warned that the company operates in a very highly competitive industry with multiple national as well as local players operating in each region of the country. The Indian market is a price-sensitive market and therefore, fluctuations in the raw material prices cannot be easily passed through to the customers leading to pressure on profit margins. Rising health awareness in the country may steer people away from these ethnic snacks due to their high carbohydrate and fat content and low nutritional value, it added.

Bikaji Foods,Bikaji Food shares tank 13% as high input costs drag Q3 earnings,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/bikaji-food-shares-tank-13-as-high-input-costs-drag-q3-earnings-12933066.html,"Shares of Bikaji Foods International plunged 13 percent on February 7, weighed down by the company's weak Q3 earnings that suffered from high input costs. Net profit plunged 39 percent on year in Q3 to Rs 28.6 crore, down from the Rs 46.6 crore that it clocked in a year ago. The bottomline was also adversely affected by a weak operational performance in the quarter gone by. The company faced inflationary pressures on key raw materials such as edible oil, potatoes, and besan which sharply lifted its input bill. This weighed on the company's EBITDA margins eroding it by 257 basis points compared to the same quarter last year. However, revenue grew 14.5 percent on-year Rs 714.90 crore, driven by a 3 percent increase in volumes. At 09.48 am, shares of Bikaji International were trading at Rs 649.40 on the NSE. The fall was further intensified by a spike in trading volumes in the counter. As much as 9 lakh shares of the company changed hands on the exchanges thus far, already three times the one-month daily traded average of three lakh shares. Follow our market blog to catch all the live action Among categories, traditional snacks recorded a 10.5 percent on year growth in Q3, while western snacks lagged with a less than one percent rise. Packaged sweets fared better, growing 11.2 percent on year. The company also clocked in Rs 17.5 crore through PLI income during the quarter and expanded its direct coverage by around 10,000 outlets. The stock has plunged 36 percent from its peak of Rs 1,007 but remains over twofold higher than its IPO price of Rs 300.

PNC Infratech,Buy PNC Infratech; target of Rs 386: Geojit Financial Services,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/buy-pnc-infratech-target-of-rs-386-geojit-financial-services-13105324.html,"Geojit Financial Services research report on PNC Infratech PNC Infratech Ltd. (PNC) is an infrastructure construction, development and management company with the expertise in execution of projects including highways, bridges, flyovers, airport runways, industrial areas, and transmission lines. The order book remains robust at Rs 17,792cr, which is 3.2x FY25 revenue, providing strong visibility for the coming years. Given the removal of the NHAI ban, the company is now eligible to bid for NHAI, & MoRTH projects and the management is expected to add Rs15,000cr of order inflows in FY26. In Q4FY25 PNC’s revenue declined by 39.6% YoY (in-line with our estimate) due to slow progress in execution on account of delays in getting appointed dates. Consequently, EBITDA margin during the quarter declined by 70 bps YoY to 12.4%. However, the management expects the revenue to grow by 20% YoY with an EBITDA margin of 13%. PNC is also focusing on expanding its order book to the railway and water segments. Currently, the water & canal segment constitutes 17% of the order book. We expect this disinvestment and objective to diversify to other infra segments will augur well for the growth prospects. Ample opportunities in both road and non-road projects (Rs.90,000cr) with a strong balance sheet will aid in rerating.

Consolidated revenue for the quarter stood at ₹1,704 crore against ₹2,600 crore (including ₹296.79 crore arbitration award) in Q4FY24. EBITDA for the quarter came at ₹362 crore against ₹736 crore (including ₹296.79 crore arbitration award) in Q4FY24. PNC Infratech said its remaining value of contracts under execution is over ₹17,700 crore, including a contract worth ₹4,097 crore where the appointed date is awaited. PNC Infratech reported weak Q4 earnings. However, some experts point out the company's bright growth outlook and the stock's attractive valuation, which suggests one can consider buying it at the current juncture. Axis Securities maintained its buy call on the stock but raised the target price to ₹340 from ₹300 earlier, citing the company's robust order book. Axis expects the company to deliver a revenue growth of 20 per cent CAGR over FY25-27E. ""A boost in the infrastructure sector is expected with a pick-up in awarding activity and the recent allocation of ₹2.8 lakh crore to MoRTH in the Budget 2025-26. We expect the company to report revenue growth of 25 per cent in FY26, backed by a robust and diversified order book, strong order inflow, especially after the closure of the MoRTH ban, a debt-free balance sheet, and favourable government support,"" said Axis Securities. Brokerage firm JM Financial maintained a buy call on the stock but cut the target price to ₹450 from ₹470 earlier. The brokerage firm pointed out that about 66 per cent of the current backlog is under execution, and the entire backlog is expected to be executed by September 2025. JM Financial underscored that PNC has guided for 20 per cent revenue growth, which implies 30 per cent growth over the adjusted base of the previous year, and expects EBITDA margins of 13 per cent for FY26E. ""Given the delay in receipt of appointed dates, we have lowered revenue, leading to an EPS cut of 4 per cent and 3 per cent in FY26E and FY27E, respectively. Valuations at 11 times and 9.5 times FY26E and FY27E, respectively, EPS (earnings per share) remain attractive. We value EPC business at 13 times FY27 EPS and assets at ₹59 to arrive at SOTP-based revised price target of ₹450,"" said JM Financial. Nuvama Institutional Equities has maintained a hold call on the stock and slightly increased the SotP-based target price to ₹286 from ₹281 earlier. ""While PNC’s operating performance has remained soft, improving balance sheet health and higher other income compel us to revise FY26E and FY27E EPS upwards by 14 per cent and 12 per cent, respectively, and PE multiple to 8 times from 7 times earlier,"" Nuvama said. While the stock appears to be a good long-term bet, some technical experts believe investors may consider booking some profits at this juncture. Jigar S. Patel, Senior Manager of Equity Research at Anand Rathi Share and Stock Brokers, highlighted that PNC Infratech stock is encountering resistance near the R1 floor of the monthly Camarilla pivot, in the ₹318–320 zone. ""A decisive close above ₹320 could open the path toward the ₹340 mark. Considering the resistance, this may be an ideal point to book partial profits,"" said Patel.

Infra Engineering, PNC Infratech and IRB Infrastructure Developers share prices are gaining traction as order inflows that were subdued in the first quarter of FY25 due to general elections are showing signs of improvement. Ashoka Buildcon, Dilip Buildcon, KNR Constructions, GPT Infraprojects, and H.G. Infra Engineering share prices among others have risen up to 8% in the last one month. IRB Infrastructure Developers share prices, however, are exceptions as they have corrected during the same period. That said, IRB Infra has already gained significantly in last one year with the stock almost doubling in price. After such stellar gains, some profit-taking is expected. Analysts say order inflow improvement has been visible in the last few months. Vinay Kumar G, Vice President & Sector Head - Corporate Ratings, ICRA Limited, said that the awarding activity gained traction sequentially, with 589 km awarded in August 2024 (up 27% month-on-month over July 2024). However, overall awarding activity remains lower by 7% as compared to August 2023.

ICRA estimates road awards by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) at 8,500-9,000 km in FY2025, similar to last year’s awarding of 8,581 km. With improved clarity regarding order-awarding activity from the MoRTH in August 2024, project awarding is expected to gain momentum from September 2024 onwards.

Construction at the combined level stood at 600 km during the month. The competition, however, remains high and there are some concerns about the margins of these firms. Given the backdrop, Nuvama analysts say that road developers must work on segmental diversification since their ability to win adequate road orders at desired margins is now under question.

Ashoka Buildcon,"Ashoka Buildcon Extends Sale Completion Date for 5 Subsidiaries to September 30, 2025",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/ashoka-buildcon-extends-sale-completion-date-for-5-subsidiaries-to-september-30-2025-alpha-article-13210264.html,"Ashoka Buildcon Limited has announced a further extension to the indicative date for the completion of the sale and disposal of its stake in five subsidiaries of Ashoka Concessions Limited (ACL), a material unlisted subsidiary. The new indicative date for the transaction's completion is now September 30, 2025, extended from the previously set June 30, 2025. This extension has been mutually agreed upon with the proposed investor, Maple Infrastructure Trust.Transaction Extension DetailsParticularsDetailsCompanyAshoka Buildcon LimitedSubsidiary InvolvedAshoka Concessions Limited (ACL)Assets Being SoldEntire share capital (including repayment of shareholder loans) in 5 subsidiaries of ACLProposed InvestorMaple Infrastructure Trust (formerly Indian Highway Concessions Trust)Original Indicative Completion DateMarch 31, 2025 (as per Oct 30, 2024 announcement)First Extended Completion DateJune 30, 2025 (as per March 31, 2025 letter)New Indicative Completion DateSeptember 30, 2025Reason for ExtensionFew conditions precedent are in the process of being completedAction DetailsThe corporate action pertains to the ongoing process of Ashoka Buildcon's divestment strategy through its material unlisted subsidiary, Ashoka Concessions Limited (ACL). The transaction involves the sale of the entire share capital, along with the repayment of any shareholder loans, held by ACL in five of its key subsidiaries. These subsidiaries include Ashoka Highways (Bhandara) Limited, Ashoka Highways (Durg) Limited, Ashoka Belgaum Dharwad Tollway Limited, Ashoka Sambalpur Baragarh Tollway Limited, and Ashoka Dhankuni Kharagpur Tollway Limited. The buyer for this significant stake disposal is Maple Infrastructure Trust, which was previously known as Indian Highway Concessions Trust. This strategic divestment is part of a broader corporate initiative, the details of which were initially communicated to the stock exchanges on October 30, 2024, when ACL entered into share purchase agreements and other transaction documents with the Proposed Investor.Process and TimelineThe journey towards the completion of this transaction has seen several adjustments to its timeline. Initially, when the share purchase agreements were signed on October 30, 2024, the indicative date for the fulfillment of conditions precedent and subsequent transfer of shares was set for March 31, 2025. However, as the initial deadline approached, the company found it necessary to extend this date. Consequently, via a letter dated March 31, 2025, Ashoka Buildcon informed the exchanges that the completion date had been pushed to June 30, 2025.The latest announcement, made on July 1, 2025, indicates that despite the previous extension, certain conditions precedent remain unfulfilled and are still in the process of being completed. Conditions precedent are standard clauses in M&A agreements that must be satisfied before the transaction can close. These often include obtaining regulatory approvals, securing third-party consents, or fulfilling specific financial or operational milestones. Due to the ongoing nature of these pending conditions, and following mutual agreement with Maple Infrastructure Trust, the indicative date for the transaction's closure has now been further extended to September 30, 2025. This marks the second extension for the completion of this significant divestment.Shareholder ImpactThe repeated extensions in the completion timeline for the sale of these five subsidiaries mean that the anticipated benefits from this transaction will be deferred. For shareholders, such divestments typically aim to unlock value, streamline operations, or provide liquidity for future investments or debt reduction. The delay implies that any potential cash inflows or balance sheet improvements expected from the sale will now materialize later than initially projected. While the company has not provided specific financial implications of the delay, the deferral of a significant corporate action can introduce an element of prolonged uncertainty regarding the finalization of the deal and its ultimate impact on the company's financial position. Ashoka Buildcon continues to keep the stock exchanges informed of these developments, ensuring transparency regarding the progress of this material transaction.
